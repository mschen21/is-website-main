How to explain the joyful fullness of seeing your baby turn 1? 

The unexpected pitter patter of feet that can now run towards you. The firm hands that loves to pick everything up and throw it down. The independent spirit of an adventurous little soul whose smile of delight instantly rains down warmth. 

I spent months planning Noah’s party. After landing on a “firefly” theme, I consulted Pinterest only to find that no examples of this type of party existed! Can you believe it?! I’m forced to believe that I came up with a truly original idea...just kidding ;) 

Knowing we wanted to have a larger party, we couldn’t host in our small city apartment. I reached out to [Soul City Church](https://soulcitychurch.com/) on a whim from their Contact form on their homepage, hoping they had available rooms for rent. To my great delight, they had an entire brochure outlining every room in their renovated space! I saw a children’s classroom with a nature theme and knew this was \*the one.\*

To create a whimsical feel, I bought a bunch of fairy string lights and purchased tons of photo prints from Noah’s first year of life from Shutterfly. I abhor the idea of buying party decor that only gets used once and knew these items would be well loved for years to come.

My family arrived early on Saturday morning to help us bring our culinary snacks to life. We made homemade pumpkin spice popcorn and a rosemary citrus spritzer to complement the main meal of carnitas, chicharones, quesadillas, and nopal cactus salad from Carnitas Uruapan (delicious and we enjoyed leftovers for the next week).

Believe it or not, I have never baked a cake in my life! I figured, why not try for the first time on Noah’s birthday XD I bought my first cake pan and Googled birthday cake recipes. I stumbled upon this chocolate banana cake with peanut butter frosting and went for it. I went with a 9 inch cake pan instead of 5 because I wanted everyone to be able to enjoy cake, not just Noah during the smashing!

It was so sweet having our family travel to Chicago and friends come together to celebrate our baby’s birthday.

Noah had his 1 year doctor’s appointment the day before the party and had 4 vaccines shots in addition to a toe prick that did not put Noah in the best mood for his party, haha. (Sorry, baby!)

Noah’s cake smash made us chuckle. He’s never used silverware in his life but refused to smash the cake with his hand and reached for the fork. He stabbed his slice of cake with a vengeance and eventually succumbed to the more practical hand on cake technique. Funny baby.

One thing that often gets overlooked is the milestone of 1 year of becoming parents! As the days fly by, Steven and I realize the value of time more and more. 

Time together. Time apart. Time with Noah. Time to pursue our other dreams in life. 

We’ve been forced to prioritize and couldn’t have survived this past year with Steven’s mom. She selflessly cares for Noah every day while we’re at work and helps care for Noah when we go on dates, hang out with friends, and shoot photos. 

To be totally honest, it’s been hard on our marriage learning how to find time to spend time with one another and even have conversations that aren’t just about work or Noah. We haven’t been able to travel as much or work out like we used to. Sleeping in isn’t an option anymore and Noah’s schedule doesn’t differentiate between weekdays or weekends. Parenthood is hard work, there’s no way around it. 

However, it’s also beyond fulfilling and brings us closer to the family that we believe God intended for us. When we look back on our lives, we know we want to have children that we walk with throughout the course of life, God willing. Noah brings SO MUCH JOY into our lives with his mischievous ways, his irrepressible smile, and sweet innocence discovering the world. 

We wouldn’t have it any other way. Parenthood is sanctifying and ultimately, one of God’s greatest teachable moments for us. We are forever grateful.
