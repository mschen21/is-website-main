Steven's oldest sister, Jamie, recently moved to South Korea in pursuit of her latest job in August. We saw this as the perfect opportunity to visit the bustling city of Seoul!

Korean culture has taken the world by storm. From K-beauty to K-pop, Korean culture has saturated countries beyond its borders. Lots of social drinking, eating meat (especially fried chicken), long work days, plastic surgery, and giant conglomerates like Lotte and Samsung stand out from Korea.

On our first day, we visited the traditional [Gyeongbokgung Palace](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264337) (경복궁) where we rented traditional [hanboks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbok) and walked around the old villages. Even baby Noah got an outfit and looked like a little Korean emperor. Oh my heart.
