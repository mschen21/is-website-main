There’s a new sensation that’s been sweeping the nation for a while now. That sensation is none other than the smiling [pink pig named Peppa](http://www.peppapig.com/). Avika is the sweetest, most gentle and darling little girl. When her father, Nishant, reached out about photographing his daughter’s 3rd birthday party at [Little Beans Cafe](https://littlebeanscafe.com/evanston/) in Evanston, IL, we couldn’t wait! 

Our son, Noah, actually started crying a little bit while we were chatting on the phone with Nishant and he graciously said we should bring him to enjoy the party! So sweet and just the first taste of the generosity and hospitality of this wonderful family. 

Her mother, Shreya, greeted us upon arrival with little Avika in tow. They sported matching custom made Peppa Pig “3” birthday t-shirts. With giant Peppa birthday balloons, gift bags, and balloons adorning the party room, it was evident to us how much work the parents put in to make this a memorable party for their 25+ friends in attendance.

Little Beans Cafe has an area built specifically for the “little beans” aged 0-6. It’s an entire town for the littles! From a veterinary clinic to treat sick stuffed animals to a giant treehouse where there are “no adultz aloud,” to a miniature grocery store, there was clearly something for everyone!

They even hired a face painter to decorate the children’s faces. We had quite a few Spidermen, butterflies, and rainbows running around. Too cute!

Nishant and Shreya ordered catering from [Sarpino’s Pizza](https://www.gosarpinos.com/) and Honest Kids drinks for the kids as well as delicious vegetarian wraps and samosas from [Bombay Wraps](https://bombaywraps.com/) for the adults.
