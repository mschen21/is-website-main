Our hearts fill to the brim when we photograph newborns. They’re so precious and tiny and we know how fleeting this sweet time with them is after raising one. Jenna and Nate are one of our favorite couples and you may remember them from when we captured their [wedding party on New Year’s Eve](/portfolio/events/jenna-nate-nye-party/) heading into 2018 at [Pops for Champagne](https://www.popsforchampagne.com/). 

I still remember when Jenna and I worked on the same team and she was in the journey of buying her home! It was such an honor to step into their lives and Connor’s second week of life. Their dog and official “first” child, sweet Eleanor or “E,” was a real gem and graciously photobombed many of our photos with Connor. She’s always by his side and embraces her role as his big sister.

Connor set the bar high by not crying *the entire photoshoot.” Serious hats off to this little guy! He’s super long and skinny, and already incredibly alert. He gazed straight into the camera and his parents’ eyes for many of the photos. How amazing is he?! He has wiggled his way into our hearts permanently.

Since Nate works for the Cubs and Connor will clearly be a future baseball player, he posed with lots of fun baseball props :)

Jenna, Nate, Eleanor, and Connor - we love your family and can’t wait to watch Connor grow up!
