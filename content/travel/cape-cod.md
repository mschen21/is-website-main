When planning the annual family vacation with Steven’s family this year, we had a precious new addition. Six month old Noah! We normally love to go abroad, but didn’t feel like risking a long flight or time zone changes with him. As a result, we decided to sojourn to the East Coast, specifically the beautiful land of Cape Cod!

You may imagine a red and white lighthouse when picturing Cape Cod because of the famous Cape Cod chips. These iconic lighthouses dot the entire coast of Cape Cod and its surrounding islands. We gorged ourselves on amazing fresh seafood, savored idyllic drives along the ocean, and time well spent with a family that is divided by states and countries during most of the year.

We flew into Boston airport and stayed in the city of Yarmouth at the [Holly Tree Resort Hotel](http://www.holly-tree.com/). On our first night, we had an incredible dinner at [Skipper Chowder House](https://skipperrestaurant.com/). Every type of seafood made its way to our table and Noah got to sit in a high chair for the first time! We discovered that the wooden high chairs turned upside down is actually a perfect seat for car seats. My mind was blown! 

During this trip, I didn’t do diligence to all of the amazing meals we had. Mom life restricts the freedom to indulge in food photography, but having Noah there introduced a fun experience for us!

On our first full day, we toured the coast’s lighthouses and beaches. Given it was early May, we definitely still needed jackets and it wasn’t that warm yet. We visited [Sea Gull Beach](https://www.yarmouth.ma.us/671/Seagull-Beach), Sandwich Boardwalk Beach, and visited my favorite lighthouse, [Nobska Lighthouse](http://www.friendsofnobska.org/), which is the lighthouse featured on the Cape cod kettle chips bag! We even saw jellyfish in the water!

From Cape Code, we took the ferry to Martha’s Vineyard mid-day! Little did we know that everything closes at the Vineyard by 5pm and we happened to visit during their “off-season” so many of the restaurants were closed. Nevertheless, it was clear what a beautiful island it was and so peaceful too.

We rode the bus to [Gay Head Cliffs](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499462-d562220-r159959325-Gay_Head_Light_Aquinnah_Light-Aquinnah_Martha_s_Vineyard_Massachusetts.html) just in time for sunset!

We visited [Chatham Lighthouse](https://www.capecodlighthouses.info/chatham-light/), [Nauset Light Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g41555-d3445823-Reviews-Nauset_Light_Beach-Eastham_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html), and a cute windmill called [Eastham Windmill](https://www.eastham-ma.gov/eastham-windmill)! Our baby is the smiliest :)

At night, we drove to [Provincetown](https://ptownchamber.com/), which is where the Pilgrims originally landed when they reached America! It’s a cute downtown area where we ate a delicious lunch at [The Canteen](http://www.thecanteenptown.com/) (one of my favorite meals for sure) and [Mac’s Seafood](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41778-d5504290-Reviews-Mac_s_Fish_House-Provincetown_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html) before visiting [Race Point Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g41778-d560324-Reviews-Race_Point_Beach-Provincetown_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html). Another favorite meal was [Spoon and Seed](http://www.spoonandseed.com/), a local eatery founded by a husband and wife. Everything was spectaular. I had a pork belly grits and it amazing! 

Before ending our trip, we stopped by the [Samuel Adams Brewery](https://www.samueladams.com/brewery-landing/boston-brewery) in Boston for a free brewery tour! Besides visiting the Guinness Factory in Dublin, this was the best brewery tour I’ve visited. They give you plenty of beer tastings (3-4) and it’s all free! The tour is quick and the tour guide showed boundless enthusiasm.

This week away from work and our everyday lives provided so much refreshment and sweet time together. I’ve missed being with Noah all day, every day and this was so sweet. Experiencing a new place together, with so many relatives that love one another is all you can ask you. So thankful for another fun week together this year!
