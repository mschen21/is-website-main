I can hardly believe Noah has doubled his lifespan since his [first month of life](/journal/noah-first-month/)! To me, he’s already looking like a little boy, not quite a baby anymore. Since turning 1 month, he’s started changing rapidly. Here are some of the changes we love:

- Not crying during diaper changes anymore
- He’s found his voice and loves to socialize with us with baby gurgles. Favorite sound: “ah goo” 
- Able to track objects with his eyes now and make eye contact
- Blowing spit bubbles
- Chubby cheeks appeared
- Loves bath time
- Officially 11 lbs at the 2 month doctor’s appointment
- Loves to eat/lick his hand for comfort & entertainment

Our alert little buddy.

We always throw Noah’s bath towel and new outfit in the dryer right before his bath so he’s warm and cozy afterwards. Kind of thinking someone should do this for us as adults as well!

First time wearing a two piece outfit to go out to the mall! Not sure it gets cozier than this to brave the Chicago winter.

He loves to chill and talk to you on the changing table. It’s so fun!

We were asked to read one of the Advent readings at church together as a family! Noah slept peacefully meditating on the word of God.

One of our favorite times of day is the morning with Noah. He’s always refreshed from the night and ready to tell you about all the things that happened to him while we were gone.

One week, we had two nights out in a row without the baby! My newly married sister and brother in law, Beth & Michael graciously came to Chicago to help babysit. I think Noah had a great time with them ;) Noah especially liked pulling on Beth’s long luscious hair.

Noah also loved meeting mommy & daddy’s friends! So fun getting to see the world through his eyes.

Can’t forget about tummy time! His neck strength is only getting stronger & stronger!

One of the biggest highlights from this month was visiting [LA over Christmas](/travel/christmas-in-la-2018/) with him. He rocked his first flight by sleeping and eating the whole time under my nursing cover. He loved the white noise and soft vibration of the plane. Toddlers cried all around him, but being a relatively young baby, flying felt easy with him. I know some parents dread bringing their babies out, but we love integrating him into the lives we are living and want to create so many new memories with him.

Noah got to wear all the newborn size short sleeved onesies I thought he wouldn’t get to enjoy since this age corresponds with the Chicago winter!

Touching the ocean for the first time. He looks perplexed, and perhaps discomforted by this sensation, haha!

He did like lounging on a blanket by the beach with his mom and dad though.

After the beach, he experienced his first desert! He wasn’t a huge fan of the sun, but real Vitamin D sure beats the Vitamin D drops that we have to feed him in Chicago!

It was so sweet seeing Noah meet his great grandparents. Also, his cute little “My First Christmas” outfit really melts our hearts.

We love you, sweet boy. Don’t grow up too fast!
