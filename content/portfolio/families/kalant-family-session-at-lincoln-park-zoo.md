We treasure our friendship with the Villegas family! Our story started back in Indiana when we attended the same church. Wanchen was a single lady and hadn't yet met Chris! Fast forward a few years and they now have a beautiful one year old named Lydia.

Wanchen and I walked through pregnancy together (alongside another one of our dear friends, Maysa). We had babies born at the end of Oct (Noah), beginning of Dec (Titus) and beginning of Jan (Lydia). Every time I think of our babies, I can't help but see God's grace and faithfulness in our journeys.

Chris' mother helps take care of Lydia during the week while her parents work, so it meant so much to have Chris' parents present as well given their instrumental involvement in Lydia's life.
