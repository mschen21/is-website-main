Short sleeved onesies. Uncontrollable giggles. Gripping our arms and new toys. These small steps towards new milestones have filled our hearts with indescribable joy this past 5th month of life for Noah. 

It wasn’t all roses as we also encountered his first dreaded sleep regression. Instead of sleeping all the way through the night from 7pm-7am, he now wakes up 1-2x per night again. We’re trying to get him to sleep all the way through again, but it is definitely a challenge. It’s also a daily reminder to learn how to put his needs above our own!

Here are some of our favorite new developments in this 5th month!

- Delighting in jumping in his new rainforest jumper. At first, his feet still couldn’t reach the ground and he simply wanted to stand rather than jump. Now he’s bouncing all over the place and we know he’ll love walking / running someday. 
- Everything that touches his hands goes into his mouth (our bodies, play mat, bibs, burp clothes, stuffed animals,  you name it). His hands and even feet are starting to move purposefully. When we read to him, he places his hands on the books and now even his feet. Maybe he’s kicking away the books he doesn’t like so far, like “Quantum Physics for Babies” (who can blame him)
- Things that make Noah laugh: pretend pounding his chest like Tarzan, roaring like a lion, growling like the cookie monster, nuzzling / kissing his cheeks, noisy eating sounds, pretending to sneeze…”achoo!”
- He started pursing his lips and frowning to express his displeasure. It’s kind of the cutest thing ever as he learns to express more emotions. 
- Playing peek-a-boo!
- He likes to talk to us when he’s going down for naps or to sleep, even when the pacifier in his mouth is muffling all of his “words.” He’s a little talker!
- Enjoying bath time! Loves the sensation of water being poured on his tummy. 
- Wearing 6 month clothes in addition to a few 3 month old clothes. Love trying on new outfits!

When Noah wakes up at between 6-7:30am, every fiber in my body wants to sleep. But, once he’s up, he is definitely up and it’s better for me or Steven to spend 1-1 time with him than bring him into our bed where neither of us get that extra 1-2 hours of shut eye. My mornings with Noah usually comprise of making breakfast together, talking, playing, or reading. The biggest perk of this morning time is he’s usually the happiest and honestly, it’s always worth it.

It’s wild even reminiscing on one month’s worth of photos as I can literally see his hair grow longer as the month progresses and clothes he fit into in the earlier weeks actually don’t fit anymore. In fact, Steven tried stuffing him into one of our favorite grey onesies and it ripped. RIP onesie.

We take Noah on all the adventures of our normal lives and he is such a delight. Below is when we went to dim sum at Mayflower Restaurant and when we are sitting in the back seat together. He started grabbing his own pacifier and taking it out of his mouth. Developing hand eye coordination already!!

At the beginning of the month, he was eating a variety of fingers except his thumb. By the end of the month, he found his thumb and now that he has “explored” his entire hand, he’s moved on to any other object in his reach. Such an observant and adventurous little buddy :)

Noah makes us laugh. Whether it’s his funny faces or random spit up moments, no two days are quite the same.

He had some fun times meeting new friends!

And of course, seeing one of his favorite aunts, Aunt Karen! We had great Korean food while Steven’s family was in town at Ahjoomah’s Apron.

Noah loves to match me & Steven. Always by choice of course. ;)

Noah loves going to the library where he can meet lots of new friends and play with new toys. Yep, he built that block tower all by himself!!! ;)

He always gets lots of quality Facetime with his grandparents, aunts and uncles who live in Indiana.

Our little adventurer.

One day out of nowhere, Noah started being able to frown and make this adorable pouting face. It is so funny and cute.

I won’t lie. This month I feel extra sentimental because I’m in the last week of my maternity leave. I know, I am SO grateful for the past 6 months I’ve been able to savor with Noah (both outside of and inside my belly). It just flew by so quickly. It’s been the most incredible time and I know I appreciate it so much *because* I have to go back to work. I will miss Noah so much during the day, but am so grateful that my mother in law will be caring for him. 

Stay young forever, my love.

Happiest of 5 months to our Noah bear. We know the next month will be just as transformational and we feel so blessed to be your parents <3
