Short sleeved onesies. Uncontrollable giggles. Gripping our arms and new toys. These small steps towards new milestones have filled our hearts with indescribable joy this past 5th month of life for Noah. 

It wasn’t all roses as we also encountered his first dreaded sleep regression. Instead of sleeping all the way through the night from 7pm-7am, he now wakes up 1-2x per night again. We’re trying to get him to sleep all the way through again, but it is definitely a challenge. It’s also a daily reminder to learn how to put his needs above our own!

Here are some of our favorite new developments in this 5th month!

Delighting in jumping in his new rainforest jumper. At first, his feet still couldn’t reach the ground and he simply wanted to stand rather than jump. Now he’s bouncing all over the place and we know he’ll love walking / running someday. 

Everything that touches his hands goes into his mouth (our bodies, play mat, bibs, burp clothes, stuffed animals,  you name it). His hands and even feet are starting to move purposefully. When we read to him, he places his hands on the books and now even his feet. Maybe he’s kicking away the books he doesn’t like so far, like “Quantum Physics for Babies” (who can blame him)

Things that make Noah laugh: pretend pounding his chest like Tarzan, roaring like a lion, growling like the cookie monster, nuzzling / kissing his cheeks, noisy eating sounds, pretending to sneeze…”achoo!”

He started pursing his lips and frowning to express his displeasure. It’s kind of the cutest thing ever as he learns to express more emotions. 

Playing peek-a-boo!

He likes to talk to us when he’s going down for naps or to sleep, even when the pacifier in his mouth is muffling all of his “words.” He’s a little talker!

Enjoying bath time! Loves the sensation of water being poured on his tummy. 

Wearing 6 month clothes in addition to a few 3 month old clothes. Love trying on new outfits!

When Noah wakes up at between 6-7:30am, every fiber in my body wants to sleep. But, once he’s up, he is definitely up and it’s better for me or Steven to spend 1-1 time with him than bring him into our bed where neither of us get that extra 1-2 hours of shut eye. My mornings with Noah usually comprise of making breakfast together, talking, playing, or reading. The biggest perk of this morning time is he’s usually the happiest and honestly, it’s always worth it.
