{{< background-text-fullwidth >}}First looks are always one of our very favorite parts of the day. Lauren shared a first look not only with Adam, but also her father! Cue the tears. It was very sweet. I'd happily advocate first looks between daughters and fathers for every wedding!{{</ background-text-fullwidth >}}

{{< background-text-fullwidth >}}We've always wanted to attend a Jewish wedding and we finally got our wish! There are many Jewish traditions and it was a joy experiencing them through Lauren & Adam. First up, the signing of the Ketubah. It's a Jewish wedding contract that Lauren & Adam signed in the presence of Rabbi Foster, their families and witnesses. Pamela Feldman-Hill of Pearl Editions handmade and customized their Ketubah with loving care in Columbus, OH! Absolutely gorgeous and decorated with incredible care.{{< /background-text-fullwidth >}}

{{< background-text-fullwidth >}}Next up: the beautiful ceremony! Lauren walked down the aisle with both her parents and the couple circled each other a total of seven times to create a sacred space with the promise of protection that Lauren & Adam are making to one another as it reminds them they are the center of each other's worlds. Their program described each element in detail, which really helped us understand the Jewish customs.

Within the beautiful ballroom, Lauren and Adam wed under a beautiful floral chuppah, the traditional wedding canopy. It represents the home that Lauren & Adam will establish together. The sides are deliberately left open to signify that family and friends are always welcome in their home. The chuppah incorporated Lauren's grandmother's weaved tablecloth that was used on her confirmation many years ago and Adam's Uncle Frank's tallis that was used during the ceremony.

Rabbi Foster began the ceremony with the Kiddush, a shared cup of wine symbolizing life's sweetness and the fact that they are ready to share their lives together. The Sheva B'rachot or "Seven Blessings" are seven wedding blessings that consecrate their spiritual bond by encompassing the themes of creation of the world, continuity of the Jewish people and state of Israel, happiness of a married couple, and importance of family. 

Another unique aspect is the exchange of rings where they placed rings on each other's right index finger, as it's believed to be directly connected to the heart. Rings have no beginnings and no ends, symbolizing love that is complete and never ending. Amen to that!

One of our favorite parts? The breaking of the glass!

Adam stepped mightily on a glass, signifying celebration as guests share a big Mazel Tov. It's a reminder of how beautiful and fragile life can be and that relationships should always be treated with great care, love and respect. So many special elements filled with thoughtfulness and rich spiritual significant made this ceremony one to remember. Immediately after the ceremony, Lauren & Adam retired to a private room to share their first moments alone as husband and wife before rejoining the wedding celebration in a tradition called the Yichud!

Last but not least, the reception to end all parties! Their bridal party pulled out all the stops for best entrance dance moves. The Andrew Blake Band played absolutely incredible cover music and Sobol family friends performed a surprise song for the first dance, mother/son & father/daughter dances. The daughter is fresh off Broadway's Sound of Music!! So amazing.

The absolute best part was the Jewish chair dance, or "hora" that came out of nowhere. As we were enjoying the reception, a song came on that magically prompted all family and friends to link arms around each other, dance in concentric circles, and start lifting Lauren and Adam into the air bouncing on chairs! Oh my goodness. I will never forget that lively dance. Even Jody & Todd got a turn in this unforgettable dance.
