Ping Tom Park in October has a particular charm with its ability to have colors of spring and fall in the same park. We first met Fareeda when we captured her 2nd birthday party a week earlier at [Kids Wonderland](https://www.kidswonderlandchicago.com/)!

The Ibrahim family showed up in beautifully matching fall outfits and we had so much fun hanging out together. I think you’ll agree that they are an unbelievably photogenic family ;)

We can’t wait to continue walking through life with the Ibrahims together!
