This month encompassed the most milestones in a month yet! Noah learned to crawl and stand all by himself. We are in awe (mostly still shocked). As a parent, I think we live in a limbo of emotion oscillating between excitement when baby learns a new skill, disbelief that change is happening so quickly, and pangs of sadness that our babies are changing before our very eyes.

At the beginning of the month, Noah started to love exploring human faces. He would stick his hands on our cheeks and in our mouths. When sitting in our laps, he’d turn his body to see what’s underneath his high chair, or see who is potentially standing behind whoever is carrying him.

Simple baby toys are also starting to bore him. He knows the real world is out there now and wants to explore all of it! He prefers standing to sitting, loves riding and following around the Roomba and Dyson vacuums, and eats pretty much any food (but loves cherries). He also likes drinking water with his parents, particularly Hint water.

At first, Noah didn’t know how to rest on his knees. He’d use his arms and feet to sit up, but would be stuck since he didn’t drop to his knees. Eventually, he figured it out and Noah could only crawl/scoot backwards. His hards weren’t moving yet. That lasted for a day before he started slowly moving forward. By the 3rd day, he was crawling all over the home! He loves chasing iPads, remote controls, and bouncing balls. Most of all, he loves finding people like his mama, dad, and grandma. He likes to crawl to our legs and hug them to try and pull himself up.

We left Noah at home with grandma for the first time ever to go to my friend Sally’s wedding in Sonoma, California! We missed him terribly, but also appreciated this time to reunite with high school friends and enjoy time with one another.

Although Noah already has 2 teeth, he never showed any tell-tale signs of teething with those. With more teeth starting to come in, he’s starting to get fussy and feel the pain. He also outgrew his pacifier and sleep sack, and doesn’t need or want those to go to bed anymore. He loves babbling and speaking his mind. For the first time, he can also now hold his own bottle and truly feed himself! Growing up too fast...what’s next, he’s making us dinner?! (Okay, that would be kind of nice).

Noah sleeps on his stomach now and tucks his knees under his body like a little frog or dog. It’s super cute. When he doesn’t want to sleep, he pulls himself up to standing position and waits at the edge of the crib until someone comes to get him. He has a strong preference for spending his time with people and standing. I sense an extrovert!

It comforts me that some things still haven’t changed. Like the fact that Noah still prefers eating books over reading them. I see now why most children’s books are hardback, haha!

Things that make Noah laugh:
Saying “HEY!!” with great excitement
Saying ya-ba-doo-bee-doo!!
Playing peek a boo
Growling or roaring at him

Noah has been the greatest blessing in our marriage and our hearts are full getting to be his parents. So much love for him and can’t wait to see what happens in his 9th month of life!
