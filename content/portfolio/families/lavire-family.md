With the leaves finally turning orange and fall weather 
settling in Chicago, it was the perfect time to commemorate this snapshot 
in time in the LaVire family's lives. Al and Alicia have been married 
around a decade now and have two of the cutest little boys known to 
mankind, Cy &amp; Stu. Together, they are the #LaVireBros.  

Al &amp; Alicia lead our small group at Park Community Church. This group has been a huge 
blessing in me &amp; Steven's lives and we couldn't be more thankful for the 
incredible friendship we've found in the LaVire's! They graciously open up 
their homes to our group every week. Not only that, but they are fabulous 
cooks and make the best home cooked meals ever that we get to look forward 
to every Wednesday. They also introduced us to Moody Tongue Brewery, now 
one of our favorite places to drink beer out of wine glasses and eat 15 
layer German chocolate cake! 

We met the LaVire family at Ping Tom Memorial Park, a hidden gem in Chinatown. Cy and Stu sported cute matching ties and 
shoes - the boys have style! (Or should I say, Alicia)? :) We had so much 
fun exploring the park and keeping the boys happy with plenty of gummies 
and Lays Stax.  

Al &amp; Alicia, it was an honor getting to document this 
special time when Cy is 3 and Stu is still a baby! These moments are so 
precious and will never be taken for granted. Can't wait to walk alongside 
each other's lives in the years to come!
