**Doha, Qatar  
**February 2020  
  
Many months ago, one of Steven's best friends from his MSIS graduate program at IU invited us to his wedding. This wasn't just any wedding. No, it was an Indian wedding in INDIA!

Attending an Indian wedding has claimed a spot on our bucket list for a long time. The days long affairs are the stuff of legends and allured us with their colorful celebrations.

We booked our flight to India on Qatar Airways and saw that they offered an option to take a day long layover in Doha with a 5-star complimentary hotel stay. As a result, we decided to knock another country off the list and visit Qatar :)

They had just built a brand new subway system for the upcoming World Cup and it was the nicest one we've ever been on. We used the subway like locals across the entire city.
