With Noah on the move, it’s starting to feel like a new beginning where he’s starting the journey to being a little child and not just a baby anymore. He’s a joyful little dude and we adore him. 

Here the latest in Noah’s 9th (oh my goodness) month of life.

+ Babbling things like “a boo bluh” and even a “ba-ba-ba” (which I refuse to believe is dad, I mean c’mon…)
+ Loves to eat cherries and feed himself
+ Not getting mad when we use the NoseFrida on his nose now
+ Has a great time riding in grocery carts at Costco
+ Mastering the art of dropping on his bottom from standing up holding on to something. It’s super cute.
+ Crawling at super fast speeds
+ Adores his grandparents on both sides
+ Loves to be held and carried. People > toys!
+ Our little guy is a mover and hates to be restrained to things like strollers and car seats as well as being on his back during diaper changes. Road trips are quite the undertaking now!
+ Loves to gaze up at us when he’s in the stroller or being carred in the Baby Bjorn
+ His favorite toys are the vacuum cleaner, giant mops, remote controls, and straws
+ Noah is naughty and doesn’t like things on his head like hats anymore. He’ll grab it with his hand and drop it on the ground (mic drop)
+ Noah likes to stand up in his high chair. No fear.

Noah’s little smile and pure excitement for life make our hearts so full.

With the start of his 9th month of life came his first July 4th holiday! Naturally, I had to get a super cute outfit for him from Target :) My sister, Beth, and brother-in-law, Michael came to Chicago to celebrate together.

We also took Noah on his first swim!! He doesn’t love it yet as I think he feels like he isn’t on safe footing, but it’s super fun putting him in his wet suit.

Noah loves Chinatown. Gotta teach him to love dim sum early! When we’re at restaurants, chewing on straws is Noah’s favorite activity.

Noah loves meeting all of our friends!

Noah’s first time at the “kids table” as the littlest of them all.

We went home to Indiana a few weekends where his grandparents and aunts shower him with love. This photo of Noah visiting the playground with grandpa always makes me smile. That grumpy face with the arm outstretched to touch the water...hilarious.

Adventuring with Noah is my favorite :)

Noah has become more of a daddy’s boy recently since Steven started working from home more!

We love Noah endlessly and still marvel at the opportunity to be his parents.
