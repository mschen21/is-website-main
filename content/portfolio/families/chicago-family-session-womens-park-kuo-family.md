It's hard to find a family sweeter and more playful than the Kou's. Belinda is exceptionally kind, artistic and generous. Most of all, she's an unconditionally loving mother to her daughter, Natalie, and soon to be baby Evelyn! Jack is direct and to the point, the best play (and nap) mate for the girls. Natalie is a bundle of energy - lively, independent, and adorably spontaneous.

Steven and I have loved getting to know Belinda & Jack through our small group and also exploring our neighborhood eats together :) We shot this session in the Chicago Women's Park on an unseasonably cold winter day. Despite the cold, their smiles warmed up the park and we had an amazing time with a cute little sheep scarf to boot!

Jack & Belinda are expecting baby #2 by end of December, so this photoshoot is a special way to remember their time as a family of 3!

Natalie is extremely playful, so of course we spent a few minutes of the session letting her run around... :) We also found out that fruit snacks are great motivation for staying still.
