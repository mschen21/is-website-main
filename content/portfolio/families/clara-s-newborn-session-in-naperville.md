I first met Chloe through our time as bridesmaids together for one of our best friend, Christina’s wedding! We ended up using the same wedding photographer ([Maria Harte Photography](https://www.mariahartephotography.com/)) when we got married and now live in the Chicago area together :) I met Ryan through various mutual friends from our alma mater, Indiana University. Chloe is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet and Ryan is easygoing and fun. Naturally, together they make the best parents.

We were so, so excited when baby Clara entered the world! She sweetly stayed calm during our entire session and didn’t cry once. Her sweet demeanor melted our hearts.

The Ciesla family has a gorgeous home in Naperville and we couldn’t have asked for a better in-home newborn session!
