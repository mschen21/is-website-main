Could there be a better way to celebrate New Year's than gathering with your closest friends and family at [Pops for Champagne](http://popsforchampagne.com/) after a destination wedding in Hawaii? This is exactly what Jenna & Nate did and we are so honored to have been able to celebrate not only the New Year, but their wedding party with them in Chicago.

When you meet Jenna & Nate, you probably think power couple. Jenna is my dear friend and fellow Googler. She's also an extremely talented ice skater who coaches the [Starlights synchronized skating team](http://www.starlights.us/) that competes all around the world. In addition, she has a huge heart for animals (especially dogs), and is a dog mom to little Eleanor, a cute rescue pup. Nate received the title of "[unsung hero of Cubs' epic Game 5 victory](http://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/cubs/unsung-hero-cubs-epic-game-5-victory-doesnt-even-wear-uniform-theo-epstein-maddon-contreras-rizzo-nlcs)" from NBC Sports for his work with the fabled Chicago Cubs, and helped the team win the World Series last year. Jenna & Nate have both had exciting years, leading to both of them getting their rings (World Series, engagement, and now wedding)!!

Despite their amazing accomplishments, what stands out to me is their humility and and authenticity. Throughout the night, everyone surrounded them with love and hugs and even some lifts off the ground. Delicious food, champagne, and fun party decor around every corner. I loved getting to meet Jenna & Nate's friends from all walks of life and celebrate this unforgettable night.

The Pops for Champagne waitstaff strolled the venue offering delicious h'ordeuvres and champagne flowed freely. DJ Shane Creepingbear kept the party bumping with upbeat music. Fun photo booth props adorned every table. Absolutely loved the vibe of the night, all planned by Jenna's amazing sister, Kristi! At the stroke of midnight, Jenna & Nate even cut a cake together. Magical!

After midnight, [Giordano's pizza](https://giordanos.com/) arrived and more people slid onto the dance floor. Our lives are compilations of stories composed of the people around us. Extended family, friends from college at Miami of Ohio, ice-skating friends, and baseball friends shared fun snippets of the past. I met one of Jenna's ice-skating friends from college who used to lift her during their routine. They decided there's no time like the present to re-enact the lift. One of my favorite moments of the night by far!!

Cheers to Jenna & Nate, whose lives are just beginning as the newly married Halms. I've said it at least one but I'll say it again -- thank you SO much for having us at your New Year's extravaganza. It was the wedding party of 2017 to remember!!
