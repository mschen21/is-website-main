Somewhere along the way of moving from being half a year old to 7 months, I stopped wishing Noah would stay a baby forever and came to terms with the fact that every month will be fun and I’m actually looking forward to every new thing now as his mom! 

Noah officially has a full head of hair and has mastered his hand eye coordination. With that hand coordination has come the ability to push us away when he doesn’t want to put on clothes or have a pacifier in his mouth anymore. He’s always been a strong-willed personality and now he realizes his body can accompany his voice - uh oh! 

However, he’s mostly a very smiley boy and comfortable being held by anyone. Bath time now involves little toys that he likes to try to hold and eat. 

Here are the latest developments in Noah’s 7th month of life! 

- Loves grasping his own baby bottles with 2 hands now (but hasn’t mastered the art of drinking by himself yet)
- Started sitting up all by himself!!
- A really great eater - there’s nothing Noah doesn’t like! 
- Super alert and always swiveling his head to look at who is holding him, who is around him, and every new noise
- Likes to sit up in the stroller, car seat, and bathtub rather than relaxing and laying back
- The 2nd tooth has arrived!
- Flipping from back to front and front to back in the crib now! At night, he rotates 360 degrees. He prefers sleeping on his side instead of his back now.
- Some chubby arms have appeared :’)
- Started flapping his arms up and down when there’s a food nearby he wants to eat
- Likes to grab his feet when lying on his back
- Giggles like crazy when you fly him up in the air or tip him over backwards

Our family celebrated a very proud moment together as Steven graduated with his MBA from Indiana University!! His family, aunt and uncle, as well as my siblings headed to Bloomington, IN to help celebrate this huge accomplishment. His third degree from IU and second Master’s Degree! Noah and I are so proud of him.

This month also started off with Steven’s family’s annual vacation! [We headed east to Cape Cod](/journal/cape-cod/) this year and had a wonderful time. Noah had just started being able to sit up for a few seconds on his own before falling over. 

During this trip, we also learned that Noah *loves* to hold water bottles. Especially giant metal ones that make resounding echos when you bang on them. 

Between whale watching and chasing lighthouses down the coast, I have to say we loved having Noah at sea with us. Sadly, the end of the vacation also resulted in Noah’s first time getting sick! He had a cough for about a week, which interrupted his sleep and eating schedule. It was super sad to see him suffer and sad cry, but we are grateful it didn’t last for too long

After our vacation, we had yet another exciting celebration...my brother Elijah’s medical school graduation!! I never thought this day would come, but he is officially Dr. Huang!

Noah played piano for the first time. His musical talent, aka slamming his entire hand on the keys, proved quite masterful.

Another amazing moment this month was my first Mother’s Day!!!! Oh my goodness. It was so sweet. Despite Noah being sick, he made a card with his dad for me and Steven made me a wonderful breakfast of a leftover Taco Bell taco, chives dumpling and a hard boiled egg. To be honest, it was perfect :) 

At church, the kids handed out pink carnations for all of the mothers. I used to be one of those kids and it felt *so* full circle to be receiving one myself for the first time!

Our friends, Brandon, Kelsey, and Jared all came to visit in one weekend! Loved having these sweet friends over.

We took a trip to the wndr Museum with Jared. It’s basically an Instagram museum, but was super fun, especially with little Noah!

Our favorite room of the museum...this mirror room which changes people’s sizes based on what side you’re standing on.

Noah is so dear and smiley.

He’s very curious and always looking at what’s happening around him.

Big accomplishment...Noah turned 200 days this month! I know this isn’t something that most parents keep track of, but wow there’s such a difference between 100 and 200 days.

We started taking Noah to the playground and he rode the swings, a little rhino and went down the slide (with help) for the first time! My heart swells with emotion thinking about these little milestones.

Grabbing his little feet.

Attempting selfie with Mommy. Fail, but at least we captured his 2 little teeth!

I haven’t found that the working mom life gets easier. I miss him just as much. However, the time does fly faster, which reminds me to treasure each minute. Noah, it’s hard to believe you’re closer to a year than to the day you were born. We adore you, we love you, and are so thankful to God for you, our greatest blessing.
