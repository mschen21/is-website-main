The Donohoe family welcomed a 5th member to their family last year, little Tom! He’s so cute and completes their family. It was a true honor getting to photograph their family for a second year around the city of Winnetka.

Katie & Brian are amazing parents and I am huge fans of their other kids too, MB & Lennie. Twas a lovely fall session and we can’t wait to continue watching the kids grow up!
