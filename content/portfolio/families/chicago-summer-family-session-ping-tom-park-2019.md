We first met the Dresden family when Steven and I used to serve as teachers in the preschool class at our church. Dylan, a spunky and sweet blonde haired boy and one of our students, immediately stole our hearts. 

Fast forward to a year later when I went out on maternity leave and joined the mom’s small group at our church. Lisa and her daughter, Bella, became my friends and poured so much life into me during these hard and sometimes lonely newborn days! We had play dates at the Harold Washington Library and I always appreciated Lisa’s authenticity, frank honesty, and ability to become friends with anyone. 

Noah used to love sucking on his pacifier and it would oftentimes fall out. When it did, Bella would help pick it up and put it back in his mouth. Obviously it was friendship at first sight! Bella adores babies and was such a great big sister to him. 

Now, the Dresden family is about to embark on another great adventure of adoption! Steven and I are so humbled by this brave step they’re taking and how Scott & Lisa humbly lead by example. We are so thankful to have helped memorialize this time in their lives: before they add a third child and right before Dylan starts kindergarten.

Scott entertained the kids, keeping smiles on their faces all evening with lots of tosses and spinning in the air.

As parents, it’s easy to only take photos of the kids and not document stages of your marriage past the honeymoon! I love that Lisa & Scott so obviously love each other. They are high school sweethearts and such a beautiful couple.
