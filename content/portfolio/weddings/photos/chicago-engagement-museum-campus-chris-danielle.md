You may remember Chris and Danielle from when we captured their [beautiful winter proposal](/portfolio/weddings/photos/chris-danielle/) outside the Lincoln Park Conservatory. Chris and Steven are classmates from the MSIS graduate program at Indiana University and we first met Danielle over hot pot at [Little Lamb](https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-lamb-hot-pot-chicago-2) in Chinatown. It was a double date made in heaven and we are so excited for them as they start the journey to marriage!

We started their session at one of our favorite locations, Ping Tom Park. We had beautiful sun streaming through the willow trees and captured some of our favorite engagement photos of all time!

Chris did an incredible job with the ring :)

These two are some of the nicest people we have the privilege of knowing and they’re truly the perfect pair. From Danielle twirling Chris in our “twirling” photos to their passion for board games, we can’t wait to continue hanging out in the wonderful city of Chicago and attend their wedding in Milwaukee in a few short months!
