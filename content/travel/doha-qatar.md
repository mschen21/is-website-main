Doha, Qatar  
February 2020

Many months ago, one of Steven's best friends from his MSIS graduate program at IU invited us to his wedding. This wasn't just any wedding. No, it was an Indian wedding in INDIA!

Attending an Indian wedding has claimed a spot on our bucket list for a long time. The days long affairs are the stuff of legends and allured us with their colorful celebrations.

We booked our flight to India on Qatar Airways and saw that they offered an option to take a day long layover in Doha with a 5-star complimentary hotel stay. As a result, we decided to knock another country off the list and visit Qatar :)

Qatar Airways booked us a stay at the [Marriott Marquis City Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/dohmq-marriott-marquis-city-center-doha-hotel/), which was the best Marriott we've ever stayed at. We got upgraded to a _massive_ suite and had access to the Executive Lounge through Steven's status, which is always a treat.

At around 50 degrees, we found the chilliest weather of our trip here so we had to wear the one jacket we brought each the whole day, haha!

Knowing we only had one day here, we made the most of it!

Our favorite meal in Qatar (granted we only had 3). Fattoush salad, pine nut hummus with Lebanese sausage, and grilled chicken breasts with french fries complimented by a mint lemonade. <3

Overall, Qatar was a quieter, beautiful and modern city perfect for a day trip. We loved it and are so glad we had the opportunity to pass through! :)
