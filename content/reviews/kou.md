"We had such a wonderful time working with Ivana! She captured beautiful photos of our family, which wasn’t easy with our little two-year-old running around. She’s accommodating, patient and has a great eye framing shots, posing everyone and capturing natural lighting in all her photos. We would definitely recommend Ivana & Steven to anyone who is looking for a great photographer!" - Kou Family
