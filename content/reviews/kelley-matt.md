"We loved working with Ivana for our wedding! She was so calm, professional, and easy to work with before and during the wedding, which helped a nervous bride and groom. She also was able to capture such beautiful and special moments from the day. They tell the story perfectly, and we will look back on these pictures fondly. I would recommend her to anyone!" - Kelley & Matt
