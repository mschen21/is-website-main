I first met Steph when she joined our team at Google near the end of last year. We get the privilege of working together on a very well-loved brand, Southwest Airlines. She had just gotten back from her maternity leave and time with her new baby, Elle!

Right from the beginning, Steph entered our team with a bright smile and enthusiastic attitude that radiates energy every day, to this day. Not only is she a beast seller and stellar at her job, she's the chief party planner and constantly has ideas for fun whether it's with our clients, our team, or with friends. She is such an inspiration and wonderful person to be around. I feel so blessed to work with her and also get to know her husband, Max, most adorable daughter, Elle, and bowtie wearing pup, Teddy. 

You may have seen Elle's 1st birthday party on the blog last week! We followed up that fun party with a beautiful summer family session in a gorgeous neighborhood park in Glenview, with a fun cake smash to follow featuring tutus, pearls, and a funfetti birthday cake.

Sweet Elle has so many funny things she does. She likes to pick up the phone (her hand) when it "rings" and blow people kisses. Pasta is one of her favorite foods and puff cereal too, which we discovered later in the shoot. She's an intrepid explorer and is a fast walker!! It's hard to believe this little girl is already 1 year old! Her first teeth are even starting to peek out of her mouth, giving her the most adorable smiles.

After having fun in the park, we ended up time together back at the Stewart home. Steph & Max had set up the most adorable backdrop and decorations for Elle's 1st ever cake smash! Elle donned a tutu, pearls, and a glittery "1" crown and *actually* enjoyed smashing her funfetti cake with vanilla frosting (which Max baked)! Perfect baby cake smash.

Family photos are the best because they are literally freezing precious memories in time. I've decided that Finn's little arm rolls are one of my favorite things in the whole world and I'm SO glad we now have these photos to memorialize them forever! The boys gave little hugs to each other and kisses to their mom and dad that melted my heart. We played with bubble machines, listened to the Moana soundtrack, and spent the best morning playing and shooting together.
