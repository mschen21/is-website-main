## hello dear friend

We are a husband and wife photography duo in Chicago focused on natural light, candid moments, and letting love shine. We create clean, joyful, and vibrant images for you to cherish for a lifetime.

We first met in youth group and attended the same high school. Our time at Indiana University (go Hoosiers!) blossomed into a long distance relationship. Through the distance, the good, the hard, and the worth it, our relationship culminated in a marriage well worth the wait. God comes first in our marriage and we couldn't be more thankful for His plan in bringing us together. 

We photograph weddings and families in Chicago but love to travel worldwide! We are so glad you're here.
