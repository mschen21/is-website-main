Never enough time. After returning to work, I never feel like I have enough with Noah. 

This sixth month of life brought a new schedule of only 1-2 hours with Noah before and after work to spend with him outside his sleeping hours. Worry about having enough pumped milk for his every day, wondering what new things he's doing that I'm missing and questioning my competence and/or value of my work swam through my brain. I won't lie, the first 2 weeks were hard and I definitely even cried a few tears at work. I'm thankful for the support of other mom friends who were going through or have gone through the same thing. 

All in all, this sixth month brought so much delight and newfound joy with our little one. Here are some of developments in his 6th month of life!

- Noah has different expressions like frowning and pouting now! He also gets scared easily with unpredictable sensations and loud noises
- Noah's hair grew long so he no longer has pineapple head hair. Also, it started growing past his ears so we even gave him his first hair trim!
- Noah loves watching us eat food. He also started sucking on fruit like apples and loves them!
- Whacking books closed is more fun than reading them at this point.
- Holding and grabbing everything in sight! He spent the last month discovering his hands; now he's using his hands to discover the world.
- Started trying out the tripod sitting position, but tends to fall over after a few seconds of siting up unassisted!
- Mom stopped recording every feed, diaper change, and nap (mainly because I'm at work now). It's super freeing :)
- Discovered how to make a high pitched pterodactyl noise and loves babbling
- Actively archces back to be picked up and will squirm his way out of chairs
- Laughs when we nuzzle our faces in his belly and pretend that he's stinky
- Lights up and smiles at all strangers or at his parents when we come home from work
- Adores dancing to the macarena and playing with his reflection in the mirror with mommy


One of the best things while I'm at work is receiving photos of happy Noah (even when they're blurry)!

I also traveled away from Noah overnight for the first time for my friend's bachelorette party in Austin. It was hard to figure out the milk situation and so strange to be on Facetime with my own baby! It warmed my heart though and Noah survived just fine with his dad and grandma! 

I love seeing Noah and his daddy together <3

At Google, we had a "Take Your Kids to Work Day"! Obviously Noah had to come and experience Google breakfast (blackberries and raspberries for him), get photographed for his Google badge, and meet an Android!

Selfies are getting harder to take with Noah now that he loves to grab everything in sight (like our phones).

Noah is already a good eater and loves trying foods! Fruit is his favorite :)

Noah is so blessed to have so much family that loves him and loves Facetiming with him!

Happy half birthday, Noah :) We can't believe you're now closer to 1 year old than to when you were born. You are curious, sweet, and fun. Our little adventurer that we can't imagine living without.
