It’s hard to believe that our sweet baby has hit the 3 month mark! He no longer seems like a newborn baby, but a little boy. His face has plumped up and he has the most contagious smile. He lights up our world so much.

During this month, we started sleep training and even had a night of over 10 hours straight of sleep! That was an exciting night that has yet to repeat itself, but we can usually get a solid 7 hours in a row now, which is a mighty feat in our eyes. 

We had the pleasure of dedicating Noah at our church alongside many other families, commiting to raise him the best we can in a Christian home.

A new norm for our household is now having Noah accompany us on what would have been little dates between me & Steven. For example, Noah joined us for a New Year’s breakfast of coffee & beignets at Akhirah’s Praline Candy.

A trip to Dollop Coffee downtown in the Loop.

One of Noah’s newest developments is loving to eat his hands. It’s nice because this acts as a self-soothing mechanism for him :)

At least once a day, you can find Noah dancing and smiling to his Soothe & Groove Mobile toy. This toy is literally the best and always gives us as parents 15-30 minutes of spare time back in our days! Between pumping, meal times, getting Noah to nap, the actual nap time, cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, diaper changes, and changing outfits due to spit up, there’s rarely time to relax or enjoy quality time with Steven so the time we get back is so valued. We call this one a win!!

Noah has also started paying attention when we read books! Two of his favorites include [Peek-A-Who](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811826023/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=is0f1-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0811826023&linkId=a3359a37f9377e377223e642304d9130) (gifted by our friend, Carly), [God Counts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1945270799/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=is0f1-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1945270799&linkId=861d11d8fdefa9657f852efe32cfdaea) by our friend, Irene Sun, and [The Very Hungry Caterpillar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399226907/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=is0f1-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0399226907&linkId=a4e526b6804095c79b0b0e4a154d10b5)! Can’t wait to have a little reader on our hands.

Another change that made us feel like Noah is really growing up is he started facing frontwards in the [Baby Bjorn carrier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JOSNM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=is0f1-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0009JOSNM&linkId=ed1c5b37fd5949ccce729e5dea4a2284)! He gets bored easily (every few minutes), so getting to experience the world through our eyes rather than stare into our chests has proved very exciting for him. I even got to take him on a library day to the Harold Washington Library. He loved it because there was so much to see (contrary to his expression in the photo below)!

Recently, Noah has loved staring at his feet. It’s like the first time he’s noticed they are there!

Noah started ROLLING one day from his stomach to his back during tummy time and it blew my mind! He’d do it a few times in a row for even a few days in a row. Then, all of a sudden, he would forget how to do it for a few days and start rolling again. Too funny. Is this common for babies?

He even loves to Facetime our families on his tummy.

…and stand on his feet. Maybe he’ll stand before he crawls?! Just kidding.

The tooth he was born with has started to protrude! It’s so adorable. One less tooth to worry about when he actually starts teething :)

On Wednesdays, we wear grey. ;)

Noah loves to be cradled like a baby. We joke that he’s our new boss and we’re here at his service.

Too cute in dad’s Nike hat.

At first, we mentioned that Noah didn’t love the [Ollie Swaddle](http://theollieworld.refr.cc/ivanac). However, he now takes ALL of his naps with it and sleeps in it every night! It’s so good for helping him not get startled and prevent having his sleep disrupted by night terrors. It’s wonderful because it grows with him (can swaddle looser or tighter) and you can choose to leave his arms in or out of it. Personally, I don’t think we need any other swaddle and boy have we tried a lot! Most swaddles are only good for when a baby is a particular size. The Ollie is a one size fits all, which I think makes the higher price tag worth it!

He also likes the [Mam pacifiers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IF8AHCY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=is0f1-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01IF8AHCY&linkId=bed3eb4a0c6bd98a6a22c4941b7773f4) for soothing. They’re super helpful getting him to sleep and then he usually spits it out by the time he’s asleep!

To Noah, 

You are our life’s greatest joy and gift from the Lord to us. We only pray you continue sleeping longer and sounder throughout the night, that you would continue to fill the world with your smiles and laughs, and we can’t wait to lay, crawl, and walk beside you through every season of your life, God willing. We love you so. 

Your mom & dad <3
