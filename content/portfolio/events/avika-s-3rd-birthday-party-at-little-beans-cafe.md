We love getting the opportunity to celebrate milestones in people’s lives and little kiddo birthday parties are definitely one of those! Now that we have a little one, each year represents so much more to us.

Surrounded by colorful pastel colors, [Kids Wonderland](https://www.kidswonderlandchicago.com/) provides endless fun for active toddlers. Despite living in the South Loop for years, I never once peeked in! With ball pits and carousels galore, I can see why it’s the perfect place for a birthday party.

We loved getting to celebrate Fareeda amongst so many family and friends. Her parents are an incredible power couple and everyone surrounded Fareeda with so much love all day. Amazing balloon creations and the most lovely rabbit themed cake from [Toni Patisserie](https://www.tonipatisserie.com/) adorned the space.

A few weeks later, we’d get to capture the Ibrahim’s fall family session as well. More from that coming soon :) Happy birthday, sweet girl!
