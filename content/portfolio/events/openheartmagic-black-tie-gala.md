“With wands in hand and magic in heart, we fill hospitals with happiness.” This is the mission and purpose of [Open Heart Magic](https://openheartmagic.org/), a stunningly simple yet purposeful organization that brings magic to sick children’s bedsides at the hospital. OHM trains volunteer magicians to perform magic for children, regardless of their condition to bring laughter, hope and strength in the midst of pain. 

My friend and co-worker, Hilary, sits on the board of this incredible organization. When she asked us to help photograph the gala early in 2018, we knew this would be a night to remember and an event well worth attending! It also felt like a special “parents night out” for me and Steven as Noah was born just 12 days before this and it felt nice to leave the house to celebrate at such a premiere event and help out such an amazing cause.

Tucked behind the Hancock Center lies the understated [Casino Club](https://www.yelp.com/biz/casino-club-chicago). A prestigious club filled with a weaving array of connected rooms, grand high ceilings, and the best service from the waitstaff I have ever experienced. Hilary and the rest of the OHM team orchestrated an incredibly well executed event with butler passed hors d'oeuvres, signature cocktails, a jazz trio during cocktail hour, DJ working a dance floor in the ballroom, magician performances from their sponsor: [The Chicago Magic Lounge](https://www.chicagomagiclounge.com/), a medley of casino games and silent bidding to raise funds for the organization, and a special presentation given by a family directly touched by OHM’s magic.

Divya ordered a stunning swan cake from Three Tarts Bakery. Originally, she planned on simply having it cut and served, but the fondant swan ended up being a table centerpiece given it was too good not to be displayed! The food did not disappoint either. Before lunch could even cross our minds, a full spread of delicious bread, cheese, nuts and jams, fresh salmon, and a raw bar of oysters, crab legs, and cocktail shrimp beheld our eyes. So fresh, and the perfect way to start the party. They even had walking appetizers of lamp chops, dainty spoons with scallops and mushrooms, polenta, and pesto chicken skewers. Can I hear a hallelujah?

The night started with passed hors d'oeuvres and drinks during a cocktail hour in the grand ballroom. Members of the OHM board and organization spoke to open the night. A family spoke about the impact a magician made on their son’s life after he was in an accident and hospitalized. Tears welled in guests’ eyes (mine included) when a video played explaining the mission of OHM. Truly beautiful and moving. 

Following the presentation, two emcees introduced a time of giving where guests raised programs to indicate their levels of donations they wanted to make. They started at a lofty $10,000, then $5,000, $2,500, $1,000 on down. In seven short minutes, the room raised an INCREDIBLE $70,000. Absolutely in awe! The night continued momentum with the doors opening to a taco buffet, casino games galore, and dancing the night away.

The night made for some incredible black and white moments. Black and white images tell some of the best stories!

So many amazing memories made from the dance floor and the night. Congrats to the amazing Open Heart Magic team for creating a magical and unforgettable night. Most of all, thanks to everyone who attended and helped raise money to touch the lives of the children, one magic trick at a time. We adored this #CasinoMagicale by #OpenHeartMagic!
