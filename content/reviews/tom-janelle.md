"I hired Ivana on extremely short notice (2 days) to capture my surprise engagement at Buckingham Fountain. She was extremely responsive, easy-to-work with, and even met with me twice before the big surprise to talk through the entire engagement. And it was reassuring to know she arrived an hour early to scope out the space and texted me exactly where to propose for the best angle of the city and fountain. An extra bonus was that her husband was a second shooter for no extra charge! Highly recommended!" - Tom & Janelle
