Doha, Qatar  
February 2020

Many months ago, one of Steven's best friends from his MSIS graduate program at IU invited us to his wedding. This wasn't just any wedding. No, it was an Indian wedding in INDIA!

Attending an Indian wedding has claimed a spot on our bucket list for a long time. The days long affairs are the stuff of legends and allured us with their colorful celebrations.

We booked our flight to India on Qatar Airways and saw that they offered an option to take a day long layover in Doha with a 5-star complimentary hotel stay. As a result, we decided to knock another country off the list and visit Qatar :)

Qatar Airways booked us a stay at the [Marriott Marquis City Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/dohmq-marriott-marquis-city-center-doha-hotel/), which was the best Marriott we've ever stayed at. We got upgraded to a _massive_ suite and had access to the Executive Lounge through Steven's status, which is always a treat.

At around 50 degrees, we found the chilliest weather of our trip here so we had to wear the one jacket we brought each the whole day, haha!

Knowing we only had one day here, we made the most of it! We started the day at the [Souq Waqif](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294009-d1768661-Reviews-Souq_Waqif-Doha.html), a famous shopping market that wasn't yet bustling when we arrived (tourist mistake to visit in the morning).

The famous [Spiral Mosque](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294009-d2061376-r345616976-Fanar_Qatar_Islamic_Cultural_Center-Doha.html) in Doha.

The most efficient way for police to get around of course ;)

The [Islamic Museum of Art](http://www.mia.org.qa/en/), designed by IM Pei. Such a beautiful work of art and definitely a must do! The lobby has floor to ceiling windows that make the perfect backdrop for a wedding on the water.

Qatar's economy used to depend on the pearl market until its primary export became oil.

Our favorite meal in Qatar (granted we only had 3) at [MAMIG Armenian & Lebanese restaurant](https://www.mamigdoha.com/). Fattoush salad, pine nut hummus with Lebanese sausage, and grilled chicken breasts with french fries complimented by a mint lemonade. <3

Overall, Qatar was a quieter, beautiful and modern city perfect for a day trip. We loved it and are so glad we had the opportunity to pass through! :)
