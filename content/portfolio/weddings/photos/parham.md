Childhood friends are a true treasure. Even though Kelley 
and I haven't talked in seven years since graduating high school, 
everything felt exactly the same as when we last spoke! Kelley followed my 
work through the years and I couldn't have been more honored to be a part 
of her and Matt's big day!! August 26 was a happy and fun day filled with 
love and infused with so many sentimental accents. 

Matt &amp; Kelley first met 
as interns for Georgia-Pacific in Virginia. They both work in Mississippi 
now where she makes cardboard boxes and Matt makes diapers. I mean, how 
cute is that? It's truly God's provision that brought this Indiana girl and 
Virginia boy together! We gathered at St. Elizabeth Seton Catholic Church 
 for their beautiful wedding ceremony. Their first look seriously melted my 
heart as they exchanged sweet letters, kicking off what was sure to be a 
beautiful wedding day. Their relaxed, caring, goofy, and affectionate 
personalities put everyone around them at ease to truly enjoy the day and 
have fun. 

One of the best elements of the day was an amazing trolley with 
its own decorated floral seat for the newlywed Parhams. With beers in hand 
and music blasting with the windows down, everyone's hands were already in 
the air and ready to dance at The Montage for their reception. I loved a 
sign they had with every state that had significant in their &quot;love story.&quot; 
Their bridal party broke it down with some of the most incredible dance 
move entrances EVER.  We ended the night with sparklers to send off Matt &amp; 
Kelley in style to their honeymoon in Costa Rica (incredible)! 

So much love for these two, and thank you again for having me &amp; Steven as part of your 
wedding day. Cheers to the Parhams! Way to #ParhamUp and make August 26 one 
of the most memorable nights for all guests that night :)
