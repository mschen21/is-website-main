"Ivana and Steven did our family photos in Lincoln Park, with our 10 month old baby girl. As you can imagine, shooting a very active busy infant can be challenging, but Ivana and Steven were so prepared, and ready that we were able to capture the most beautiful moments, in a very short amount of time (after about 30 minutes, the baby was over it). We are moving, and now have the best documented memories of our favorite part of the city. Thank you both we are SO happy with everything!" - Harding Family
