Last fall, Steven and I started planning this spring vacation. We found an amazing flight to Amsterdam and started dreaming about where we could go. Eventually, we landed on Amsterdam, Ghent & Bruges in Belgium, and London -- all new destinations for both of us! The Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam (AMS) is one of the largest, boasting a taxi time of up to 30 minutes! Definitely the case for us as well. 

We stayed at the simple ITC Hotel, which had teeny tiny rooms, but boasted a wonderful location in the lovely Prisengracht neighborhood. Feeling a wee bit hungry after our long flight, we cleaned up at the hotel and ventured to Foodhallen, a vast and diverse food hall, filled with worldwide cuisine. We split a Turkish kebab, crab noodle soup, popcorn chicken and Belgian fries. Very hipster and modern stores filled the rest of the building, like The Maker Store. Way cool! 

We posed for touristy photos in front of the I amsterdam letters located at the back of the Rijksmuseum. So many people! A South Korean rally shouted in front of the sign protesting the corruption of the old president. Overall a really cool area of the city with a lot of green space. To rest our weary feet, we found up at CT coffee and coconuts. It blew away my expectations! I thought it would be a tiny café but it turned out to be a three-story absolutely packed amazing café themed restaurant with the coolest ambience ever! We sat in the corner on the third floor on beanbags enjoyed a latte with delicious blueberry coconut pancakes. Highly recommend! Our dinner at O MAI Vietnamese didn't disappoint either. 

Day 2: much more rested and ready to explore the city! We seized the day with a fantastic brunch at Metropolitain en route to the Red Light District's Oude Kerk to begin our FreeDam Walking Tour (PHENOMENAL)! Our tour group consisted of 18 people from all over the world - Argentina, Switzerland, Austria, and more. Really cool to meet so many people from all over the world gathered in this one tour. Our tour guide was incredible. Highly engaging and knowledgeable. I have a special spot in my heart for awesome tours from my tour guide days at IU :'). 

We probably wouldn't have visited the Red Light District without this tour, and we learned so much history about its importance to the city of Amsterdam.  Ex pats who relocate to the Netherlands are called "UnDutchables," like our tour guide, who originally came from Florida. Amsterdam is known for its tolerance towards all things that will bolster the economy of the city. That includes a tolerance for the use of marijuana, even though it's not *technically* legal (gasp - who knew?). Prostitution is legal as well, but for an even more interesting reason. Back in the day, Amsterdam served as an important port city for sailors. These sailors, after being at sea for years at a time, were looking for 2 things when back from sea: booze & babes. If they didn't get these things, they went inland and pillaged the villages. To help prevent this, they legalized prostitution to keep the sailors *literally* at bay. It's very legitimate there - in that it's seen as another profession that pays taxes and each person is registered with the government. In addition, the sex workers are protected by police and have panic buttons in each room.

It's a very different way of thinking there, and centered around the Dutch idea of tolerance as long as it's good for business. In addition, you have to be very careful in Amsterdam to distinguish between "coffee shops" and "cafes." Cafes are what we think they are - places to eat and drink coffee. "Coffee shops" are places to smoke marijuana and that's all you'll find on the menu. Stroopwafel is the specialty treat there - syrup waffles. We found the best stroopwafels of all time at Banketbakkerij Lanskroon. The syrup is best when heated over a cup of tea or coffee, and also found on United Airlines flights. The Bloemenmarkt is Amsterdam's tulip hub. From wooden shoes to wooden tulips, they have all the expected flowery grandeur you'd expect in the Netherlands. Lots of bulbs for any future flower garden needs you may have. 

It rained off and on throughout the day - definitely bring an umbrella with you if you plan on visiting in March! We ended the day at Venus & Adonis, our nice dinner of our time in the city. It seemed to be full only of couples, so I guess it's a great date spot! We had steak, beef satay, and a massive baked potato with aioli sour cream to share. It was a little pricey in my opinion, but definitely delicious! Lastly, we went on a Lovers Canal Cruise at night to enjoy the city. Loved the views at night as we sailed past the many house boats on the canal. Many people live on the boats and as we peered inside, many were as spacious as actual houses! I can't imagine living in a boat, but kudos to the many who do. Amsterdam was an eye-opening experience to say the least, and I have to thank the FreeDam tours for providing the story of the city's rich history. 

Second stop: [Ghent, Belgium!](/travel/ghent/)
