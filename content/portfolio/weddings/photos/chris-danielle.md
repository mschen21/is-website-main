At the end of February, I received an unexpected message from Chris. Steven first became friends with Chris through their time earning a Master in Information Systems program back when they were at Indiana University. As many IU alum do, Chris ended up in Chicago like us and we are so glad! 

Last time we hung out with him and his girlfriend, Danielle, we had an incredible hotpot dinner at [Little Lamb Hotpot](http://littlelambchicago.com/) and we’ve been looking forward to getting together again. 

When the message to me included the word, “proposal,” let’s say we were even more excited this time around!! He said he thought of me and Steven first and those are magic words we love to hear. When couples think of us as their first choice for walking alongside them during these pivotal life-changing moments like getting engaged, we can’t help but think we have the best jobs in the world. 

Over the next few weeks, we planned out our plan of action to delight Danielle and help Chris put a ring on it. He chose the benches outside [Lincoln Park Conservatory](https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/lincoln-park-conservatory) to propose because this is where they ended their third date two years ago.

Photographing a proposal requires a lot of sleuthing and ninja prowess. To prepare for hour of discretion, I sat by this fountain pictured above and sneakily took photos as they walked towards us. At times, I pretended to be a random girl in a red beanie taking selfies of myself to get a clear view of where they were at all times.

As Chris and Danielle rounded the corner of the fountain where I was perched, I had to tiptoe around to the other side as they passed me so I wasn’t in Danielle’s line of sight once they sat down on the bench.

Chris started his proposal by giving Danielle a card to read.

He then stood up from the bench and got down on one knee to ask the magical question. There were many happy tears from Danielle. Of course she said yes!!

At this point, Steven and I were in full “snap as many photos as possible” mode. Chris revealed us to Danielle and I absolutely love her expression. She hadn’t made the connection that it was us yet!

When we’re capturing proposals, we like to do a mini engagement session for our couples. Love these next few favorites!
