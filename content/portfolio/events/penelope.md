Walking alongside our clients in exciting seasons of life is our favorite thing in the world! This weekend, we had the honor of documenting 6 month old Penelope’s Greek Orthodox baptism at the [Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral](https://annunciationcathedralchicago.org/). The Cathedral lies in the heart of the Gold Coast neighborhood and has a [rich history](https://annunciationcathedralchicago.org/about_us/history) dating back to 1892. 

When you step inside the majestic cathedral, regal gold embellished archways crown the ceiling while red poinsettias lined the stage. Penelope’s long baptismal white gown, bonnet, and sparkling cross necklace served as symbols of her upcoming baptism. Baptismal elements like the bottle of oil, bar of soap, decorative candles, and baptismal fount sat on stage ready for the ceremony. 

Over thirty family and friends flew in from New York and all over the country despite the huge snowfall covering Chicago to celebrate the joyous event of baptizing Penelope into the Greek Orthodox church. Her baptism symbolized the beginning of her life as a Christian and the joy of the day felt palpable in the air!

An important role in the Greek Orthodox tradition is the role of the godparent. Penelope’s new godmother nailed her new role, keeping sweet Penelope content throughout the afternoon.

The baptism included being submerged in the baptismal fount three times, being anointed with oil, the cutting of hair, her first communion, and circling the baptismal fount. Penelope’s great-aunt also had the honor of singing during the ceremony, which added a special sentimental touch.

Even Penelope’s big brother, John, jumped on stage because he wanted to participate!

After the baptism, everyone walked over to the [Blue Door Kitchen & Garden](https://bluedoorkitchenchicago.com/) for a celebratory reception with a custom menu in Penelope’s honor! With so many guests in town, toasts were in order. Everyone gave thanks for Penelope and wished her many blessings from God in her life as she embarks upon her Christian journey.

Emily and Perry, Penelope’s parents, outdid themselves with special custom made [Icons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon) of Saint Penelope as gifts for each household in attendance. In addition, tables displayed authentic Greek treats like 100 year old recipe baklava, sweet pastries and Jordan almonds. As relatively new parents of John (2 yrs old) and Penelope (6 months old), they humbly asked for help and support from their families in raising Penelope. Their wonderful extended family has already buoyed them in love not only for that day, but for the days to come. As new parents ourselves, this touched our hearts and we have no doubt that Penelope is loved so well.

We loved this incredibly beautiful day and feel so honored to have celebrated with the Skoutela family!
