Since getting married 3.5 years ago, Steven and I have gotten to visit Taiwan a whopping three times! Steven spent his childhood in Taiwan until the age of 8 when he moved to America. The scents of the street market, the rush of motorcycles on the street, and delicious eats around every corner will always feel like (a second) home to us.

This trip felt extra special to us because Noah joined us for the very first time! We rode Eva Airlines, which has a direct flight from Chicago to Taipei. The flight attendants loved Noah and provided a supply of diapers, baby snacks, and tiny toys to help keep him occupied. A bassinet that folded into the wall in front of our seats served as a little bed for him. So perfect and we couldn't have been more grateful! On the flight there, we rode the fabled [Hello Kitty themed flight](http://www.evakitty.com/en/index.html). The livery features Hello Kitty on the menu, silverware, and every plane product. 

During our time in Taipei, we stayed at the lovely [Just Sleep Hotel](https://www.justsleep.com.tw/main/en) in the heart of Taipei. It provided free breakfasts that were some of my favorite meals in Taiwan! They had a little baby hammock that Noah loved to swing on :)
