On Feb 1, a miracle happened. 

Noah slept through the night for 12 hours straight! The best part is…it didn’t end there. He slept 12.5 hours the next night. 13 hours the night after that. 13.5 hours the night after that. At this point, we started getting worried, but he ended up finding a happy medium right at 12 hours. 

Our nights of sleep training paid off and it made a huge different in our lives (mainly mine) as I only had to wake up to pump instead of care to a crying baby instead :) We are so proud of him. It felt like tough love at times, but the dividends are sleep and free evenings. The ironic part is we miss him when he is asleep for half the day!

This 4th month of life brought so many joys and fun memories! Here are some new developments from Noah. 

- Loves smiling and laughing to nursery rhymes, the Macarena, trilling tongues, and silly sounds

- Eating his hand — especially his index finger and thumb together!

- Not a big fan of sitting. Would rather stand at all times to constantly observe the world around him!

- Laughing hysterically when tickled or when mommy and daddy bury their faces in his belly

- Grip of steel on everything he touches…mommy’s hair, stuffed animals, bibs, and more

- Started grasping, but not yet playing with, toys!

This is the first month where I feel like Steven and I started to have a life again too. There’s no doubt that the transition to parenthood takes a toll on your social life. The baby joins you everywhere (which I actually love most days) and/or you don’t leave the house after 7pm because baby is sleeping by then and you can’t leave him alone. It’s hard to get used to, but the payoff of the most incredible child is well worth it. 

I’ve found that being a mom is full of paradoxes…you never want your baby to grow up and yet you love experiencing every new “first” achievement. You want your baby to stay small and wear size newborn forever, but you love seeing your baby wear new outfits and do things like sit in the high chair and not slip in the bath. You want your baby to meet all of your friends and family, but also love you the most still.

I never imagined my love for Noah would be what it is now and I can’t even imagine loving another child as much or more! It’s crazy how your heart expands when you have a baby and is never the same size again. 

Okay, enough about our feelings! On to cute pictures of Noah! :) 

Noah loves hanging out in his crib. He’s started hugging the stuffed animals, which is the cutest.

It’s wild even reminiscing on one month’s worth of photos as I can literally see his hair grow longer as the month progresses and clothes he fit into in the earlier weeks actually don’t fit anymore. In fact, Steven tried stuffing him into one of our favorite grey onesies and it ripped. RIP onesie.

We take Noah on all the adventures of our normal lives and he is such a delight. Below is when we went to dim sum at Mayflower Restaurant and when we are sitting in the back seat together. He started grabbing his own pacifier and taking it out of his mouth. Developing hand eye coordination already!!

At the beginning of the month, he was eating a variety of fingers except his thumb. By the end of the month, he found his thumb and now that he has “explored” his entire hand, he’s moved on to any other object in his reach. Such an observant and adventurous little buddy :)

Noah makes us laugh. Whether it’s his funny faces or random spit up moments, no two days are quite the same.

And of course, seeing one of his favorite aunts, Aunt Karen! We had great Korean food while Steven’s family was in town at Ahjoomah’s Apron.

Noah loves going to the library where he can meet lots of new friends and play with new toys. Yep, he built that block tower all by himself!!! ;)

He always gets lots of quality Facetime with his grandparents, aunts and uncles who live in Indiana.

One day out of nowhere, Noah started being able to frown and make this adorable pouting face. It is so funny and cute.

I won’t lie. This month I feel extra sentimental because I’m in the last week of my maternity leave. I know, I am SO grateful for the past 6 months I’ve been able to savor with Noah (both outside of and inside my belly). It just flew by so quickly. It’s been the most incredible time and I know I appreciate it so much *because* I have to go back to work. I will miss Noah so much during the day, but am so grateful that my mother in law will be caring for him. 

Stay young forever, my love.

Happiest of 5 months to our Noah bear. We know the next month will be just as transformational and we feel so blessed to be your parents <3
