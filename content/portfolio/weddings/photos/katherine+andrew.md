I first met Katherine almost four years ago through our mutual friend Kelsey, at our shared alma mater, Indiana University. I took graduation photos for their group of Phi Mu friends and it's so surreal that Katherine is now getting married!!

Katherine and Andrew started dating their junior year even though Andrew happened to be the second person Katherine met at IU. In my humble opinion, friendship is one of the greatest ways to start a relationship. Andrew grew up in Indianapolis and has never gravitated towards big cities. With an upcoming trip planned to New York, Andrew knew this would be the perfect guise to throw Katherine off from thinking he would pop the big question. With fun events from seeing Dear Evan Hansen to delicious dinners and strolling Central Park, can you think of a more perfect weekend to also ask the love of your life to spend forever with you? It's certainly hard to top :)

When they decided they wanted to start our engagement session in La Colombe, I couldn't have been more excited! Who doesn't love wood aesthetic coffee shops, paisley mugs, and well - coffee?! I couldn't be more excited for these two as they begin this exciting step in their engagement journey!!

Secret alleyways and sparkling lights decorate the West Loop. It's such a cool urban environment to take engagement photos. Katherine & Andrew have great taste! Katherine looked stunning in an off shoulder teal dress and Andrew matched in a formal black suit. Despite the cold wind, they braved it like champs and never stopped smiling. You two are amazing!

The magic "golden hour" is always hands down the best part of any photography session. Katherine and Andrew's smiles warmed each photo, complemented by the glowing setting sun. So much love for these two and my favorite photos from the session are below :)
