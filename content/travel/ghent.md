We woke up at 5am in Amsterdam to catch the train to Ghent, snacking on Stroopwafel during our ride. I wish we had more trains in the US. They're the best mode of transportation - so scenic and fun! Our Airbnb, a stylish rooftop apartment, also wow-ed. It was beautiful, spacious, and the loveliest home we could have imagined for our stay in Ghent!  

We stopped by Bakkerij Benny & Ingrid down the street for a breakfast of quiche, a crossaint, and coffee. It's owned and managed by a husband, wife, and daughter, who are simply the most welcoming people. A elderly woman walked in after us and waved as we smiled at each other. She came over to us and though she was clearly Flemish, spoke in perfect English to welcome us to the bakery. She animatedly told us the people who own it are very nice and wished us a good trip. This set the tone for our trip to Ghent :) Everyone exuded kindness and we adored our time here.

Our first sight-seeing adventure was visiting the Gravensteen Castle. As we attempted to take a selfie in front of the castle, a nice passerby asked if she could help us and offered to take our photo in addition to telling us the castle was a wonderful choice. Belgians are the best! <3 As we entered the castle, an enthusiastic teacher leading a field trip of young children dressed in medieval garb excitedly chattered in Dutch about the legends of the castle. How could you not love this city?! The castle included ~15 different stops that varied from the dungeon to the rooftop, tight winding staircases to torture rooms, and grand fireplaces. Each room was a surprise, and the sheer size of the castle was pretty amazing. I honestly enjoyed it SO much!

The fun continued with a visit to the 91-meter tall Belfry of Ghent! It's only â‚¬2.70 to visit if you're under the age of 26 (whew, just made it). We climbed 300+ stairs, huffing and puffing to reach the top. Every 50-75 stairs, they had a museum displaying the mechanics of the bells, interesting dragon displays, and more. The views were INCREDIBLE! They reminded me of the views from Berliner Dom during my time in Berlin (2014 and 2015). 

One of the best parts of visiting Ghent (can you tell it was my favorite destination of our trip?) was being able to feel like a local. I felt transported back to a medieval era in this small lovely town with the nicest people.  St Bavo's Cathedral also impressed with its spacious Gothic architecture. It features gilded wood and marble alongside a painting by Rubens and the world-famous Ghent Altarpiece painted by Hubert and Jan van Eyck around 1432. We had lunch at Passion to try some authentic Flemish Beef Stew (Stoverij). So delicious and a comfort food for sure! The Daskalides Chocolatier caught our eye so we hopped by for a taste of our first Belgian chocolates. All in all, such a lovely time in Ghent! Our 24 hours there was perfect to fully enjoy the city.
