# The Maternity Session Style Guide

{{< figure src="/images/anderson-family-2019/afam3.jpg" width="100%" >}}

#### What Every New Mama Needs to Know

The maternity session is one of our favorites because we get to capture this time in your family before you enter (or re-enter) a new & exciting chapter of your life into parenthood. Not only that, but we get to create something so special together. You’re going to be married for over fifty years, but you only get to enjoy this time as husband and wife without the title of mom and dad once. I'm so excited to capture the only time in your life when you get to be each other’s husband and wife. I created this guide for you, and packed it with all my best secrets for getting the best out of your maternity experience, so let’s dive right in!

#### Choosing Time & Date

I'm a natural light specialist because I believe that natural light, from the sun and its reflections, creates photographs that feel fresh, timeless and true to you as a couple. To get the most out of your session, please plan a buffer when getting ready so you can arrive a few minutes early to your session and be ready to start on time. We’re only able to shoot when natural light is still in the sky, so we’ll want to take advantage of every minute we have together before the sun goes down. If you’re wearing two outfits, save your favorite one for the second half, and if you’re wearing one, arrive in that.

#### Selecting the Right Location

The location of your maternity session is up to you! The first thing to decide is whether you’d like to feature nature or a city feel in your session. I'm always up for exploring new spots and cities that are special to you! I also have lots of ideas in the city and am happy to offer suggestions.

#### Think Outside the Box

This is the time to think outside the box! I encourage you to brainstorm unique locations that you might have special access to that most people don’t. For example, maybe you, or someone in your personal or professional network, can secure permission to a location that would otherwise be off-limits, like a beautiful private estate, country club or the Cubs stadium. Maybe it’s a family ranch, upscale hotel or even an airplane hangar. The sky is literally the limit! Spend a few minutes thinking about it and checking around. You’ll be surprised with what you come up with. Plus, if something seems out of reach, just remember: you never know until you ask! 

#### Styling your Session

Want your maternity images to look more editorial? Bring a little extra something with you! A freshly-picked bouquet for you to hold, or fresh flowers to put on something else, like a bicycle basket, tree swing, picnic basket, car bumper or rowboat, is a fun way bring a little extra romance to everyday objects.

Whether it’s larger items like classic cars, or smaller ones like blankets or hats, even incorporating just one extra styled item, could be a fun way to make your session more unique.

<h2><u>Style Tips: For Her</u></h2>

*Because you always want to remember that rosy pregnancy glow.*

<u>Dress It Up</u>

Have you thought about rocking a sequined gown, tulle skirt or flower crown but just never had an occasion for it? This is your chance to do it up! Remember: There is no such thing as “too dressed up” when it comes to your maternity session, so don’t be afraid to have some fun! If you don’t want to add a new permanent piece to your collection, a lot of our new mamas love Rent the Runway for their maternity photos because you don’t have to spend a lot to feel like a million bucks. Plus, you can send the outfits back when the session is over. Other new mamas love having a great excuse to bring a new permanent piece (or two!) into their closet!

*Quick Tip: There’s no such thing as too dressed up.*

<u>Say Yes to the Dress</u>

Long, flowy dresses and skirts look amazing on camera because they bring extra movement to the photos. Especially when there's bright sun hitting the fabric or beautiful flowing wind. Cute, shorter-length dresses photograph beautifully as well. Dresses and skirts tend to look most stunning on camera because they really flatter the female body — which is probably why the red carpet is always full of so many dresses and not very many pantsuits! I recommend avoiding pants and shorts for your session, and saying yes to a dress or two!

<u>One or Two? It’s Up to You!</u>

Most of our new mamas who choose two outfits will bring one “wow” dress, and then another longer sun dress for a more casual “us on a date” feel. But if you want to bring two “wow” dresses and forgo the more casual dress altogether, give yourself permission to do it! The camera loves runway-esque apparel and so do we! Remember, though, you don’t have to bring two looks if it’s too stressful or you’d rather just stick to one fabulous look. One outfit that you love will be so much better than one outfit you love and another you’re not very excited about. So, one or two? It’s really up to you!

<u>Choosing Colors</u>

When choosing colors for your outfits, I recommend selecting lighter tones and more muted shades. By avoiding ultra-bright, bold colors, it will help bring all the attention to your faces and let the eye focus on the way you feel about each other. The camera loves shades of soft pink and muted blues, mixed with sophisticated light neutrals like heather gray, creams, leather brown and white. That softer color palette fits beautifully into almost all natural outdoor environments.

<u>Coordinating the Looks</u>

As you’re coordinating your outfit with your husband, keep in mind that your outfits will look the most cohesive on camera when the color palettes coordinate, but don’t necessarily “match.” You should each aim to wear a different dominant color, but stay within a similar color palette family. So if you’re wearing a blush dress, soft blue earrings and nude heels (blush being your dominant color), then he could wear a navy coat with gray pants, paired with brown leather shoes and maybe even a blush pocket square. Now he has his own dominant color (navy) while still incorporating a few touches of your color palette. Most of our new mamas choose their dress first, and then put together your spouse's outfit based on that. That’s why we have a section for each of you.

<u>Flattering Your Features</u>

In my experience, every woman, regardless of her shape has an area of her body that she’s self-conscious about, so recognizing what that is in advance is key. Choosing flattering silhouettes and colors that complement your natural features is the best way to ensure you’ll love the way you look in your photos. Three-quarter length sleeves create an awesome slimming effect on all arms, so be on the lookout for an option with a longer length sleeve. You could also bring a cute jacket, blazer or cardigan along, too. Skinny straps or strapless dresses have the opposite effect on arms on camera, so we recommend avoiding those whenever possible if your goal is a set of slimmer-looking arms. Heels elongate women’s legs, making them look fabulous. Closed-toes heels in particular look great on camera because they carry out the line of your leg all the way down to your toe. If your toes are showing in a peep-toe heel, you might want to schedule a pedicure before your session so you don’t regret letting your feet show. These little tricks make all the difference! The big focus will be on your bump anyways :)

Quick Tip: Bring a pair of easy-to-kick-off flats to wear when moving from place to place in between photos. Your feet will thank you later!

<u>Make a Statement</u>

Pairing an accessory or two with your outfit can really help bring some extra dimension to your images. Big statement necklaces bring a lot of pop to the photos, while the smaller, delicate ones are not be as noticeable on camera. Belts, bracelets and earrings bring great visual interest, so choose one or two that don’t compete for attention. Fresh florals in a crown or bouquet can be a really romantic touch as well.

<u>Go Pro: Hair & Makeup</u>

Professional hair and makeup is on the top of most of our new mamas’ checklists because it looks amazing and removes the stress of getting ready on your own. Whether it’s lash extensions or blown-out hair, professional hair and makeup will give you an extra boost of confidence in front of the camera, and it always photographs like a dream. If you’re working with a makeup artist, have her apply your makeup in natural light, if possible, so that it looks fresh and not too heavy. Plus, that’s the type of light we’ll be shooting in, so it’ll give you the best expectation of how it will translate on camera. Most of our new mamas feel like their makeup is “too much” at first, since it’s more than you would wear on a normal day, so if you feel that way at the beginning, don’t worry! Good makeup artists know how to get it just right for the camera — and our new mamas always love the final result. If you need a recommendation for hair and makeup, we work with the best in the business and have a go-to team! They’re sweet as pie, talented as heck, unbelievable professionals and wonderful people. You’ll LOVE them! Just let us know and we’ll send you their information. We know they’ll take good care of you!

*Quick Tip: Confidence. It’s always the best accessory.*

*A Little Extra Polish: Give yourself permission to get your nails done, too!*

<u>Skip the Spray Tan</u>

Although it might seem counter-intuitive, I recommend that you do not get a spray tan before your session, even a few days prior, because it tends to photograph orange even when it’s applied subtly and by a professional. Your actual skin tone will photograph the most beautifully.

<h2><u>Fashion Tips: For Him</u></h2>

*Because dapper and debonair never go out of style.*

<u>As Long as He’s Got That Suit & Tie</u>

From James Bond to Don Draper, men look most striking in a well-tailored suit. If he doesn’t have one, now’s the perfect time to invest in something he’ll wear for the rest of his life! The best part? It’s a lot less expensive than you might think! While custom suits can cost thousands of dollars, some of the most well-known brands have off-the-rack suits in their stores for a fraction of the price. Solid shades of gray or navy are a strong complement to most women’s outfits, whereas pinstripes or plaid patterns tend to distract the eye.

*Quick Tip: There’s no substitute for a well-tailored suit.*

<u>Mix It Up</u>

Grooms look great when they mix a suit coat, blazer or sport coat with a different pant color. It adds some extra visual interest, and can be more fun than wearing two full suits in a row. I'm a big fan of this fresh take on a timeless classic.

<u>Layered Looks</u>

Next time you walk by a store like J. Crew, you’ll notice the male mannequins and models are always wearing several layers at once. Layers on men look great on camera, so even when it’s hot outside, trust me when I say that it’s worth an hour or two of discomfort for photos that will last you both a lifetime. Adding another layer will bring extra dimension and visual interest to your photos. Blazers, vests and coats up the level of any look. If the temperature permits, he could even consider adding a v-neck sweater with a pop of color from a long-sleeved collared shirt and tie underneath. Don’t be afraid to get a little creative with layers!

<u>It’s All in the Details</u>

Long pants and closed-toed shoes are the most sophisticated and masculine looks for men. They draw attention away from his legs and feet and place it where you want it: on the face you fell in love with. So, for your session, it’s best to leave the shorts, sandals and jeans at home, too. Suit pants, dress pants or colored pants work best. Brown leather dress shoes complement almost every look, whether he’s wearing a full suit or a blazer and colored pants. Ties, bowties, pocket squares, colored socks, belts, tie clips, suspenders, vests and watches are sharp complements to any suit. If you bring two suits to the session, you can start with a traditional necktie and belt, then switch to suspenders and a bow tie for your second look. If two suits are too stressful, no problem! One look will do the trick! You can still mix and match accessories to complement both of her dresses without doing a full change during the session. So, either way, you win.

<u>How to Prep Your Man</u>

Most men aren’t overly excited to take photos for an hour, because they don’t have an expectation of what’s to come and why it’s so important to you. Take fifteen minutes to educate and empower your guy. Tell him why you chose me and this style of photography. Show him your three favorite sessions that I've done, explain why you love them and express to him how much it means to you. Trust us, he’ll light up the camera for you! The most common thing I hear from guys before maternity sessions is this: because of a bad experience in the past, they don’t like taking photos or don’t think they’ll be good at it. By the time we’re done, though, they can’t believe how fast it went and just how much fun they had!

<h2><u>After the Session</u></h2>

Don’t forget to plan a dinner date. You’re already going to be all dressed up! Why not take advantage of it? We know the path to parenthood can feel overwhelming, so take some time after the session just for the two of you to relax and have some fun together.

<u>Photo Delivery Timeline</u>

<u>Final Note</u>

I know I just gave you a lot to think about. I created this guide to help make your maternity session experience something you’ll look back fondly on for years and years to come when baby is no longer just a little bump. At the end of the day, though, the location you choose and the outfits you select won’t matter nearly as much as the memories you make together. Your growing family is the most important thing to me, and I want your maternity session to be a time for you to just be yourselves and enjoy it. Have fun together. Laugh a lot. And we’ll take care of the rest!
