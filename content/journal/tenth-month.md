At this point, I’m joyful that I still get to count Noah’s life in months. He is expressive, recognizes people now, and loves to play with people. He can be shy around strangers, but also loves to crawl to them. I’d describe him as “intentional.” He knows that when he bangs on things, they make sounds. He can purposefully babble while he eats and has sprouted 6 teeth that love to bite down on everything.

Noah had a fever for the second time in his life and thankfully it coincided with his 9 month appointment, so we ended up feeding baby Tylenol for the first time. So sad, yet so many snuggles.

Noah adores drinking water, spinning around while sitting in our office chairs, and playing with appliances like dishwashers, rice cookers, and toaster ovens. He especially loves hinges that he can move like our door knocker and napkin holder.

He’s silly, loving the sensation of tearing paper with his teeth and attempting to eat it. While we put on his diaper, he likes to flip over and crawl away. He laughs when you tell him no and play with him.

Noah loves crawling and though he’s stood wobbling by himself with no support, he does not love it and would rather race around the ground crawling.

We love Noah with all of our hearts.
