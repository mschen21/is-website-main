By God’s grace, we’ve made it through and to Noah’s 1st month of life! Before I describe what he’s like now, let’s start where his life began.

I clutched Steven’s hand for dear life. Steven held my shaking hand, reading me Bible verses while I laid on the operating table. My body trembled fearfully in the cold hospital room. A blue sheet hung over my chest. It shielded our view from the doctors working to free Noah from my womb during the caesarean section surgery. 

The anesthesiologist warned me  it would feel like an elephant sitting on me when the baby came out.

“A baby elephant or an adult elephant?!” I asked in desperation. I found out soon enough. It felt like a baby elephant as the doctor pulled. 

With my body numbed by the morphine from the chest down, I couldn’t feel the exact moment he came out. Steven told me he heard a cry. I couldn’t hear that one, but I heard the second as the nurses rushed baby Noah past our side of the curtain and into the room next door. 

Such a little body and yet, this moment held the greatest magnitude imaginable. After being induced at 3:30am on Sunday, 10/28, laboring for 22 hours, and the end culminating in an emergency C-section, this was a birth journey of endurance punctuated by pure joy. 

Steven joined the nurses for the first real glimpse of our baby in the back room, watching and taking pictures as they recorded his measurements. Born at 2:26am. Length of 20 inches. Weight of 6 lbs and 9 oz. 

Noah Joseph Chen, our son. 

In our eyes, absolutely perfect. I didn’t believe my heart could swell with so much love until I met this guy.

I vaguely remember them placing him on my chest for the first time. I was so exhausted I could barely keep my eyes open. I apologized as I mostly slept while my mom, my dad, Steven’s mom, and Steven’s sister, Karen, came into the recovery room one by one to meet their new grandson or nephew. After 2 hours in the recovery room, they moved Steven, Noah, and I into the mother-baby unit of the hospital to begin our three days of recovery at the hospital. We treasured these few days with our baby boy under the kind and helpful eyes of the nurses, nurse practitioners, lactation consultants, pediatricians, and all of the care staff who helped us adjust to this new stage of life.

We are so thankful for friends and family who visited us at the hospital and loved on our little guy!

On Halloween (two short days after his birth), Noah donned his first ever costume…a sushi roll onesie with a soy sauce hat!!! It was sized for newborn, but clearly too big for our little guy ;) He loves to move his hands and keep them close to his chest and head at all times. It’s hard to feel comfortable in this brand new world outside the womb.

Upon returning home four short days after arriving at the hospital, we luckily had my mom living with us for a week to help out with meals while we figured out our new lives as parents. I’ve never wanted to take so many photos and videos of someone before (that’s saying a lot), so thank God for unlimited free storage using Google Photos and apps like [Tiny Beans](https://tinybeans.app.link/JN85UDpXZz?referralCode=GZ996M), which allows you to upload memories from every day in a calendar view!

The many faces of Noah Joseph (the last one is a little milk drunk). Yes, basically every photo I take is of baby sleeping. Haha!

Hangouts with daddy. I love his little monster butt!

{{< figure src="/images/journal/noahfirstmonth/noah13.jpg" alt="Noah First Month image" >}}

Even the cats seem to have warmed up to him! We didn’t know how they’d react to a new (and more important) addition to the family. So far, they mostly just want to observe him from a distance.

The [Ollie World](http://theollieworld.refr.cc/ivanac) sent us one of their swaddles. In exchange, we took some marketing images for them! We love the color (we chose the “Sky”) and the velcro makes it so easy to keep the swaddle in place. Due to the [Moro reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_reflex), better known as the “startle” reflex, sometimes loud noises prompt him to flail his arms and legs around. This wakes him up, so the tight Ollie swaddle can be really helpful in minimizing this disturbances.

In week 2, I also had the chance to take some photos of Noah’s sweet little nursery! Living in the city, his nursery is half of our guest bedroom. It’s basically a dedicated wall for baby, but still the most peaceful room in the home ;)

Week 3 marked our little boy making many new milestones, like suddenly sprouting eyelashes, eyebrow hairs, blowing spit bubbles, and making huge improvements during [tummy time](https://www.thebump.com/a/tummy-time-when-to-start-how-to-do) (building neck muscles by lifting his head off the ground). His eyes opened wider, we started distinguishing differences between his talking and “I need something” cries, and his diapers got a little bit heavier. 

Learning more and more about Noah and seeing him grow has been the most heart-warming, and sometimes perplexing experience of our lives.

The picture on the right…I die. He’s too cute and I’m pretty sure his legs have already doubled in length since this photo!

We tried out a new hairstyle…see his adorable mohawk on the right! <3

Does Noah look like Steven as a baby? :)

Hello, our (sometimes) smiley friend :)

{{< figure src="/images/journal/noahfirstmonth/Noah_Week3-007.jpg" alt="Noah First Month image" >}}

Did somebody say it’s crazy hair day?!

Noah’s first Thanksgiving included plenty of snuggles and cuddles with so many relatives. My grandpa, who turned 91 this year, happened to be in town for my sisters wedding and I love this photo of 4 different generations!!

Steven and I started a tradition of taking an annual drone family photo last year. Though Noah decided to fall asleep, we did succeed in showing off his impressive widow’s peak and bald spot on his head. The hair is slowly starting to fill in!

Noah posing as Vanna White in the left photo below. His little hands love to hang out by his face when he sleeps.

My brother, Elijah, is a huge help when he’s home! He genuinely loves Noah so much and has created tons of tricks to keep him happy. Praying he chooses a medical residency in Chicago so we can see him all the time. Also, Noah’s little feet. How cute are they?!

Noah had the honor of attending my sister Beth’s wedding on 11/24! He’s so popular that he’s getting invited to weddings at 3 weeks old ;) I adore this picture of us as our first family of three attending a wedding!

One of the most confusing things I’ve encountered numbering Noah’s days is the fact that turning 4 weeks doesn’t equal turning 1 month! I had been counting every Monday on being the next weekly milestone, yet his 1 month technically fell on Thursday. It probably sounds very simple reading this, but I seriously had to ponder this out loud to understand how this could be the case. Can any other moms relate?!

{{< figure src="/images/journal/noahfirstmonth/IMG_7412.jpg" alt="Noah First Month image" >}}

It’s surreal that we’ve made it this far! Noah, we can’t wait to treasure each upcoming day, week, month, and year with you. You are our heart’s delight and you keep our winter nights warm.
