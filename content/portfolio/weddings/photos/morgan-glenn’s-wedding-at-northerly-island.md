Do you ever meet those couples where you see them together and you’re like wow, they belong together? Morgan & Glenn fit the bill 100%. 

Morgan’s adventurous ambitious spirit perfectly matches Glenn’s steady and confident intellect. Their friend, George, who married them summed up their relationship perfectly and captivated everyone with their love story. 

I was so honored when Morgan asked us to photograph their lovely wedding at The Northerly Island Visitor Center. Northerly Island is a part of Chicago Park District and overlooks a beautiful garden and skyline of Chicago. 

Many happy tears and hearty stories were shared that night - we will never forget it!
