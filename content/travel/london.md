The recent London attack is definitely a sad occurence after having such a wonderful and thankfully safe trip to the city :( Reading the news has been heart-breaking... it's only through prayer that we remain hopeful for what the future holds! 

Our journey to London turned out to be harder than we thought! Perhaps it's a result of Brexit, but traveling from Belgium to London via train turned out to be as complex as traveling through the airport. We missed our train because we arrived 15 minutes before departure time. Eurostar is extremely strict about closing the gate 30 minutes before departure. We had no idea! (I guess it did have a warning on the ticket...ah well)! Luckily, it wasn't too long of a wait before we got to head out on the next train. 

We arrived to Marylebone in the evening, our home in London for the next few days. For dinner, we visited the Spaghetti House. Twas family owned and full of an authentic Italian spirit, hearty portions and absolutely delicious. We couldn't finish the massive spaghetti for 2 we ordered, which meant we got to enjoy it one more day ;) On our first full day in the city, we just had to redeem our letters to Hogwarts and enter Platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross!!

Magical wizards from all over the world lined up for the chance to don a house scarf and pose (with great enthusiasm) by the shopping cart and brick wall. Worth every minute of the wait :D One of my old co-workers, Meg, recently moved to London to work at the Google office there. We stopped by the office for lunch to visit her and boy do I have office envy! It's massive and beautiful, with its own Youtube merchandise store on the ground floor. So very cool! It was the best time laughing with Meg and catching up on her exciting European ex-pat life. Many of the people who work at the London office are not British - it's very much a melting pot of people from all over the world. 

Our next stop: the British Museum. The architecture is vast, spacious, and full of interesting exhibits. There's even one displayed currently about The American Dream. Definitely one of the highlights of the trip! We then took a coffee break at the extremely popular and crowded Monmouth Coffee for a quick afternoon pick me up. The London black cabs are famous for their boxy shape zooming through the streets. We used Gett, their taxi ride app service to get around the city as it's SO spread out and our feet could only walk so much. Pro tip: using Google Maps, we found a promo code for £5 off our next 10 rides - #winning! By using Gett, we hit up all the big tourist attractions throughout the afternoon. Big Ben, Westminster Bridge, Palace of Westminster, London Eye, Somerset House, Thames River, and Buckingham Palace. 

One of my favorite places in London was the simple and lovely St. James Park. It felt so livable and I could picture taking a walk through the park every day after work or on the weekends. Lots of people exercising, relaxing on park benches, and visiting the ducks. We felt as though we couldn't leave London without visiting a pub, so we took a trip to the historic Blackfriar pub for dinner. It's not known for their food, and I think we ordered the wrong drinks. I didn't love my fruity cider or Steven's gluten-free beer, but then again, why did we order those drinks in London (haha). I'd recommend a visit for the atmosphere, but the food is a pass for next time :) 

To end the first full day in London, we took a romantic walk down the Tower Bridge at night. It took us a while to figure out how to get there and I complained of achey feet, but Steven's persistence got us there. Once I took in the view, I had absolutely zero regrets. Thanks, hon!  I've found that traveling is one of the best ways to learn about each other in marriage. A lot of things don't go to plan and you're tested at a physical, emotional, and even linguistic level. I've found that I love Steven more and more because he sees my needs oftentimes because I realize them myself and it makes us grow even closer. 

On our second full day, we leapt out of bed in anticipation of watching the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace!! Crowds of people lined each side of the street and by the sculptures lining the palace. Unfortunately, it had rained earlier in the day so they decided not to bring out the royal orchestra to play for the usual fanfare. Sigh. It was a little anticlimactic, but provides another thing to do the next time we find ourselves in London! Instead, we visited the many shops and street vendors of Camden Market. To peruse every single shop would have taken a full day! A parade of food trucks lined the square and we definitely had to exercise self-control to keep from wanting to sample everything. We did visit Chin Chin Labs, a nitro ice-cream shop that makes ice cream to order. Our ice cream flavor was called "Pineapple ice cream w/ Chocolate Black Rice," inside a "Brownwich" (2 brownie cookies). The verdict: amazing, would eat again in a heartbeat. 

A crazy thing happened while we were walking out of the market. A group of school kids were squeezing past us on the bridge when a black clad man barreled past us through the crowd, into the throng of food trucks. A police officer yelling into his radio followed in hot pursuit. It was a wild chase, something that felt straight out of the movies. It seemed like a robbery since the man in black seemed to be sheltering something in his coat. We wandered back into downtown London's Covent Garden, a trendy shopping district. While playing in the Apple store, we found a phenomenal Groupon for afternoon tea at the Academy Hotel! Normally priced at £21.95/person, we got to enjoy a lovely platter of sandwiches, scones, biscuits, desserts, and tea for £21 in total! We really lucked out, because normally they end afternoon tea at 4pm, but they extended it just for us and we got the whole tea room to ourselves. Oh the bliss!  

On the way to the Tate Modern, we even got to share one of our leftover biscuits with a homeless man on a bridge. For some reason, this small act is one of the most memorable times from our vacation. The Tate Modern = trippy and very avant-garde. I liked recognizing pieces like "The Urinal" by Duchamp, which is also featured at IU's Art Museum. Before wrapping up for the night, we stopped by The Larrik  for the most satisfying pale ale and fries with aioli. Another day well done! Loved The Larrik! On our last morning, we strolled around Daunt Books before our breakfast place opened. I haven't been to a bookstore in a long time, and we shared a few chuckles reading about things British people love to say, do, and tweet.  Our lovely breakfast at La Fromagerie felt like a visit to the local dairy and bread store. All their ingredients are so fresh, probably helped by the fact that they're also a sweet little market. Steven had the Bacon Sandwich and I had the Haas Avocado on Toasted Sourdough with pancetta & ricotta on top. Divine! One of my favorite meals of the trip.

A Gett car took us to Trafalgar Square  where we hung out at the National Portrait Gallery. I really enjoyed it because unlike other historical art museums, each of these portraits really seemed to capture the personality of the subject... more like a photograph! For our last meal in London, we had supremely delicious pizza at PizzaNativa. We shared and loved their Salamino pizza <3. We left extra early to prepare for our first EasyJet experience back to Amsterdam. 

Surprisingly, it was super easy and nice! Once we arrived at the Amsterdam Courtyard Marriott, we were so happy to relax. Due to Steven's elite status with Marriott, we somehow got upgraded to the penthouse suite! Say what?! It is only times like these that make me think being married to a consultant is an okay life. They had 2 rain shower heads, a balcony, and an enormous water jet bath tub. Seriously the best accommodation to end our trip. So thankful for God's goodness. Small twist: the bathtub actually made screaming noises every two minutes for the next 15 minutes after we finished using it, which scared the heebie jeebies out of me. Just a small bump in the grand scheme of a restful night. 

Au revoir, London. Until next time, Europe! :) If you enjoyed reading this post, check out the rest of our Euro trip below!
