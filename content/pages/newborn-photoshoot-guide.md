# The Newborn Photoshoot Guide
 
#### What Every Client Needs to Know
 
Steven and I are so excited for your newborn session! We’re so honored to help you create memories you’ll cherish for a lifetime. We’ve created this guide to help you get the most out of your photos, and by the time you’ve read through this, you'll have all your questions answered and feel more than ready and prepared for your session. Then we’ll take care of the rest! Your only job is to be yourself, laugh a lot and let us create photos you’ll love forever. We can’t wait to get you in front of our cameras!

#### Choosing Time & Date

We’re natural light specialists because we believe that natural light, from the sun and its reflections, creates photographs that feel fresh, timeless and truest to you. Newborns tend to be happiest in the morning, so early morning shoots are the best! We recommend scheduling your newborn session prior to when baby is born and within their first 14 days of life because they sleep the most soundly during this time. 

#### Preparing the Right Locations

Our in-home newborn sessions are some of our favorite because we get to show off your family in the comfort and familiarity of your home. A few of our favorite spots to shoot are in your bedroom on the bed, in the nursery, in bassinets, and by windows for natural light. Making sure these areas are free of clutter is essential to creating clean timeless images.

#### Styling your Session
 
Want your photos to look more editorial? Bring a Cuddle + Kind doll, cute swaddles, blankets, and vintage props to place around your baby. We are creative people who love to capture the details surrounding your baby to make your photoshoot truly memorable. 
 
<h2><u>Style Tips: For Mom</h2></u>

*Because you always want to remember this.*

<u>Say Yes to Being Beautiful Again</u>

After giving birth, you may not feel camera ready, but that doesn’t mean you can’t look that way! This a perfect day to do your hair and makeup (maybe for the first time since giving birth). These are pictures you’ll treasure forever, so don’t be afraid to go glam!

<u>Choosing Colors</u>

When choosing colors for your outfits, we recommend selecting softer, lighter tones and more muted shades. By avoiding ultra-bright, bold colors, it will help bring all the attention to your faces and let the eye focus on the pure love you have for your baby. The camera loves shades of soft pink and muted blues, mixed with sophisticated light neutrals like heather gray, creams, leather brown and white. That softer color palette fits beautifully into almost all natural  home environments. This color palette applies to dad too!

Flattering Your Features

After carrying a child for 9 months, it takes at least half that time to go back to normal! You will be a beautiful (and likely tired) glowing mama, so be confident and focus on the physical recovery rather than losing the pounds. 

Cozy sweaters or long sleeved blouses tend to flatter postpartum bodies and be friendly to nursing bras. Simple jeans or leggings work well since you should be exuding comfort in your own home!

<h2><u>Prepping Your Baby</h2></u>

*Because they won’t be little forever.*

<u>Prepping Your Little One</u>

During the first week or two of life, newborns are delicate and require special attention to their bodily needs like hunger and sleep. Below are a few helpful tips to help make the most of our newborn session!

- Keep the bedroom and nursery super warm so baby is comfortable. Tossing swaddles and blankets in the dryer help keep them nice and cozy!
- Keep baby awake for 1.5-2 hours prior to the session so baby is nice and sleepy during session. Taking a bath usually helps keep them awake, plus they’ll be clean and smell nice!
- Wait to feed baby until right before or right when session starts so baby isn’t hungry

<u>Mixing Up the Pieces</u>

Feel free to plan a medley of outfits for baby. From adorable little bonnets to swaddles to wrapped blankets and no clothes at all, this is your time to remember baby so young and small as they will never be so tiny again.

<u>Final Note</u>

We know we just gave you a lot to think about. We created this guide to help make your newborn session experience something you’ll look back fondly on for years and years to come. At the end of the day, though, the location you choose and the outfits you select won’t matter nearly as much as the memories you make together. Your future memories are the most important thing to us, and we want your session to be a time for you to just be yourselves and enjoy it. Have fun together. Laugh a lot. And we’ll take care of the rest!
