Ivana and Steven were so great to work with for our son’s one year family photos. They were very responsive, offered us plenty of date options and suggested a pretty and convenient location.  We did the photoshoot on a very hot and humid day, so I was worried about how we would look, but of course, the photos turned out beautifully and you couldn’t tell how sweaty we were! They were both very patient with our son and did their best to get him to smile. They even brought him a birthday treat! They provided plenty of time to make sure we got enough photos. We never felt rushed and we progressed naturally throughout the shoot. Ivana and Steven are very reasonably priced and wonderful to work with. I definitely recommend them for any life event.
