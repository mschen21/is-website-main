On a beautiful sunny day in Niles, MI, Jake and Andrea 
gathered to be wed. You may remember them from our lovely engagement 
session  a few months ago at the Morris Estate. Andrea is organized, loyal, 
and exceedingly dedicated to everything she sets her mind on. Jake is her 
perfect complement, the king of silly faces and a faithful companion. 
Together, Andrea and Jake are an energetic, fun, and loving couple. 

They meticulously planned so many thoughtful details for the day: a sunflower 
toss to honor Andrea's grandfather as they were his favorite snack. Popcorn 
seeds as wedding favors because they love popcorn. The list goes on and 
on.  True joy filled every moment of this intimate Morris Estate 
wedding. Their first look almost had me in tears as they read heart warming 
letters to one another and exchanged gifts right before going down the 
aisle to say &quot;I do.&quot; 

I loved this wedding as it brought together so many of 
our Indiana University and Cru friends.  #AndreaAndJakeCutTheCake. That 
they did, and so much more. May this wedding day be but the start of a 
healthy and happy marriage for you both! Your wedding day was unique, 
elegant, and memorable, and you have both touched the lives of so many 
around you as evidenced by the MoH and Best Man speeches.  

Cheers to the Carsons!
