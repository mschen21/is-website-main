When Steven and I planned to go to Banff and Jasper National
Park with our friends: Dasha, Sal, Elle and Alex, we had no idea our
flights would coincide on Canada Day  - and the special 150th one at that!

To get to Banff, you must fly to Calgary. Since Steven and I arrived a day
early on June 30, we got to enjoy the entirety of Canada Day as faux
Canadians. Whereas July 4th in the US tends to be gatherings of friends at
houses for BBQ's or lake houses, Canada Day is very communal. ![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary003.jpg)There are parades and festivities across the entire country of Canada, and tons of red and white worn by all. Waving free Canada flags and donning Canadian pins helped us blend in :) We started our morning at Prince's Island Park, a very cute park filled with families and a large CANADA 150 sign. 

![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary006.jpg)The park connected to Chinatown, which had so many people! Canada is incredibly diverse, which I really enjoy.  The smells of Chinese food lured us into Great Taste Chinese Restaurant. Great taste confirmed. Super authentic menu where we enjoyed eggplant with garlic and pork strips as well as a Shanghai noodle dish - wonderful! I dragged Steven to bubble tea next at O'Cup.![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary008.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary009.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary015.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary016.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary019.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary020.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary022.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary024.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary025.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary027.jpg)![](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ivanasteven-web-assets/Calgary028.jpg) They only take cash (normal), had great flavors (awesome), but the drinks literally tasted like sugar and powder. I can't speak for the smoothies, but the milk teas were good only with copious amounts of ice. So sad! It wouldn't be Canada Day unless we immersed ourselves in a bit of Canada's history. Since it's Canada's 150th birthday, all the museums, parks, and most tourist sights were free! As the lady who let us into Fort Calgary  museum winked at us and said: "The price is right." Fort Calgary is the original birthplace of Calgary. We learned about how the Canadians took control of the land from its indigenous ancestors. It's always interesting to step back and time and see what life was like back in the day as well as the similarities to their American neighbors to the south. Who doesn't love music? Our next stop: Studio Bell . As the National Music Center, it lacked no shortage of interactive displays, live music, and ways to make your own music. What I loved even more was Steven's decision to indulge to a $7 lemonade from the Family Squeezed Lemonade truck. $7?! I know what you're thinking - I thought it too.  It's 32 oz of made to order lemonade featuring fresh fruit and herbs like mint, raspberry, and more. Actually so refreshing :) With a motto like "When life gives you cousins, make lemonade," how could you go wrong? As the day warmed up, we accidentally coincided with heading downtown to the busy parts of town like the Olympic Plaza . Live bands and people dressed up for cosplay conferences lined the streets.  With the arrival of Sal & Dasha, we headed to Naina's Kitchen for the most amazing stuffed burgers and poutine of all time!! Steven and I shared a pulled pork with apples stuffed burger and chicken buffalo poutine. Phenomenal for both weight gain and taste.  
Fireworks shot into the sky to conclude our epic Canada Day. I can't
imagine a better one until the 200th Canada Day! Maybe we'll be back for
that one :) Stay tuned for adventures in Banff & Jasper National Parks
next!
