## ivana

Avid documenter who loves to journal, reflect, and take a lot of pictures of food. Eager host to guests, but won't know how to make coffee given I'm a tea drinker. Big planner who loves to create agendas for vacations, birthdays, and surprise get-togethers. Can't watch anything scary unless you want me hiding behind pillows the whole time. Trying new recipes.

All time favorites:

* All things Anthropologie
* Magnolia banana pudding
* Ramen and any food adventures
* Chamomile, jasmine, or chrysanthemum tea
* Shark Tank (TV show)
* Balayage hair
* Everyday booties
* New York City
* Potlucks and get-togethers
