When Angela reached out about photographing her three little ones (aged 3, 2, and 1) as well as their dog, Sky, I knew this was a match made in heaven! I arrived at their beautiful home on Saturday where Halloween decorations adorned their patio. Little Willow showed me her cute shoes while Walton (affectionately known as WallE) hobbled to my side. Swoon! Midori showed off her beautiful bracelets and pearl necklace. After we packed everyone, including Sky, into the little red wagon, we strolled to the [Chicago Women's Park](http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/Chicago-Womens-Park-and-Gardens/) for a beautiful family shoot.

I absolutely loved these adorable aerial shots on a blanket. The two girls started off shy, but quickly warmed up and fascinated themselves with the sound of my camera clicking. They loved imitating the shutter sound looking through my viewfinder :)

Everyone had so much personality - big families are the BEST! Thank you so much to the Jue family for letting me be a part of your family for the day. I had so much fun!!!
