The Donohoe family welcomed a 5th member to their family last year, little Tom! He’s so cute and completes their family. It was a true honor getting to photograph their family for a second year around the city of Winnetka and even by the beach!

Katie & Brian are amazing parents and I am huge fans of their other kids too, MB & Lennie. Twas a lovely fall session and we can’t wait to continue watching the kids grow up!

One of my favorite photos with kids is to put a leaf in front of their face. Sounds silly, but always turns out so cute!

The Donohoe’s have the loveliest front porch that they take pictures of their kids with every year. We continued the tradition!
