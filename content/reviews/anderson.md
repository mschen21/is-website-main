"Ivana and Steven were amazing to work with and the time went by super fast! They knew how to get a toddler involved and provided great pointers to make sure the pictures came out nicely! Our two-year-old daughter had fun interacting with them and wasn't intimidated at all. Ivana provided recommendations for a couple of locations and she had great suggestions! We received beautiful pictures in no time and we'll treasure them as a beautiful remembrance of our growing family. I highly recommend Ivana and Steven if you are looking for a photographer!"
