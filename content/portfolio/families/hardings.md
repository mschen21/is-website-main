No one's smile shone brighter than baby Sawyer's when Lauren and Weston showed up in matching shades of blue and white for their family session in at [Lincoln Park Zoo's Nature Boardwalk](https://www.lpzoo.org/exhibit/nature-boardwalk). Sweet Sawyer loves the mornings (we shot at 7:45am) and lit up the camera with her contagious joy. This session meant a lot to both us and the Harding family as they will be bidding Chicago adieu in September. Lauren hails from St. Louis and it finally felt like time to return home as their family grows. I'm sad to lose Lauren as I have the privilege of working with her in the Travel vertical at Google together, but am also overjoyed for them as they embark upon this next step in the journey of their lives!

Lauren, Weston & Sawyer live in Lincoln Park and they oftentimes take walks through the zoo. Getting to document this special moment in their lives as a memento of their years in Chicago was an absolute honor. Sawyer's little arms and legs have the cutest little baby rolls and her favorite stuffed toys like the lion and elephant even made an appearance. Having these memories of what she's like at this stage of 10-11 months will be a true treasure for the future! 

Congrats to the Harding family on their beautiful baby girl and the upcoming move to St. Louis. We will miss you!!
