We first met Love & Matt through our small group at Park Community Church. They were pregnant with their now 3-year old daughter, Sophia, and facing a lot of fear and anxiety from the cyst found in her brain through the ultrasounds. We prayed and walked through this scary journey with them, trusting that God was in control, even when *everything* felt out of our control. Fast forward to now, and Sophia is the most obedient, sweet, and wonderful toddler. She’s completely healthy, and can’t wait to be a big sister to her potential “bother!”

Matt & Love now lead our small group and have been a tremendous blessing in our lives. Love loves a good deal, is a negotiations queen, party planner extraordinaire and world traveler. Matt is a sarcastic Renaissance man, who is an amazing cook + baker, and has a B.S. in Music, and not 1, not 2, but 3 Master’s degrees (Religion, MBA & JD). They helped throw us our amazing airplane themed baby shower in Chicago and have been awesome parent mentors to us! 

We’re so thrilled to have documented this special time in their lives as a family of 3.5 as they welcome baby #2 in October!

I’m a big fan of mama hugs with babies. (Can’t imagine why).

It’s rare to get photos of just mom and dad as husband and wife after you have a kid, which is why I always try and capture these for our couples!
