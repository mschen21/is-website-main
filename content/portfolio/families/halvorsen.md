I have the privilege of working alongside some of the most inspiring and amazing people at Google. Former Olympic medalists. talented videographers, people who sit on the board of directors of amazing non-profits, and even winners of the Amazing Race Season 19 like Cindy and Ernie Halvorsen!!! Cindy and Ernie now have two adorable boys named Maverick (#MightyMav) and Finn (#Finntastic5) who are too cute for words.

I met Cindy through work and really admire her hardworking go-getter attitude and approachability. She's always willing to lend a helping hand and is so humble about her accomplishments as a Googler, mom, and wife. Steven and I had a blast with this family session, especially since they have young sons. It gave us a glimpse of what our future lives will look like with our son! <3

By shooting on the Google office rooftop, we had endless entertainment for the boys. They loved the rocks and garden area, as well as the Chicago "L" car we have! Google bought it a long time ago and waited until we moved into this building to convert the rooftop to accommodate this massive train. Each Google office is personalized with fun local themes and the L car is so representative of the city! (I take it to work every day).

Mav had a whole variety show of funny faces. Below are a normal smile, scary ghoul, and monkey face.

Family photos are the best because they are literally freezing precious memories in time. I've decided that Finn's little arm rolls are one of my favorite things in the whole world and I'm SO glad we now have these photos to memorialize them forever! The boys gave little hugs to each other and kisses to their mom and dad that melted my heart. We played with bubble machines, listened to the Moana soundtrack, and spent the best morning playing and shooting together.
